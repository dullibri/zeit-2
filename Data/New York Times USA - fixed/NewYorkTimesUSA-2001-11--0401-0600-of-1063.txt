Dow Breaks Through Pre-Attack Level

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
Stocks posted big gains this past week, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to its highest close since the Sept. 11 attacks.
 The Federal Reserve's half-point reduction of short-term interest rates on Tuesday, to 2 percent -- the 10th cut this year -- was a big reason for the advance. 
Investors bought stocks on optimism that the latest cut would finally help stimulate the economy. 
 Equities got a further lift when reports emerged on Friday that seemed to run counter to the Fed's prediction that the economy would worsen, suggesting an economic turnaround had already started. The University of Michigan's monthly index of consumer sentiment, a widely followed barometer, showed a November improvement in attitudes about finances and the economy.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrials rose 284.46, or 3.05 percent, to 9,608.00, the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks that the average had closed above its Sept. 10 finish of 9,605.51. The Nasdaq composite index rose 82.75, or 4.74 percent, to 1,828.48. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 36.21, or 3.34 percent, to 1,120.31. Both the Nasdaq and S.& P. indexes regained their pre-attack levels in October. MICHAEL BRICK

Consumers Look At Corporate Conduct

BYLINE:  By Reed Abelson 

 BODY:
In the wake of the terrorist attacks, consumers are paying much closer attention to whether they think a company is socially responsible, a new poll suggests.
 About three-quarters of 1,000 people surveyed last month agreed that companies have a responsibility to support worthy causes, a significant increase from the two-thirds who felt that way in a similar poll taken in March. 
And 85 percent of them said the events of Sept. 11 made it "more important than ever" for companies to support their communities. 
 "Expectations of corporations have dramatically shifted," said Carol Cone, chief executive of Cone Inc., a marketing company in Boston. The telephone poll was conducted for Cone by RoperASW, which had also done the earlier survey that polled 2,000 consumers. 
A much larger number of Americans also said that a company's commitment to social issues affected the way they shopped. Slightly more than three-quarters said that commitment was important in deciding what to buy, compared with about half of those asked in March. More than three-quarters of those polled also said they would be likely to switch brands, assuming the price and quality were the same, to help support a cause, compared with about half in March.

Little Skimping on the Arts

BYLINE:  By Rick Gladstone 

 BODY:
Despite the layoffs, losses and austerity rolling through corporate America, many companies are not pulling back on their financial support for the arts.
 A survey of 100 major corporations conducted by the Business Committee for the Arts, a nonprofit group based in New York, indicates that support for the arts will remain stable in 2002. 
Sixty-four percent of the companies said they would maintain their level of support, 5 percent said they would increase it, 12 percent planned to decrease it and the rest were undecided. The respondents were queried during the week of Oct. 22, and the results of the survey were released today. 
 A separate poll that was conducted by the committee in July and August showed that the record $1.56 billion in business support for the arts that was reached in 2000 was likely to rise by about 3 percent this year. Rick Gladstone

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LAWSUITS; 
Lawyers' Math in Sept. 11 Deaths Shows Varying Values for Life

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
The salesman was running late that morning. He called his wife to say he was probably going to miss his meeting at Windows on the World. But at the last minute, at 8:47, he called his office to say he had made it to the restaurant.
 One minute later, American Airlines Flight 11 hit the building, the north tower of the World Trade Center. It was 100 minutes before the tower collapsed. He was 29. 
 The other day, a lawyer for the salesman's 27-year-old widow pushed back in his chair at a Park Avenue law firm and estimated how much the dead man's final suffering high over Manhattan might be worth one day in court. In another case a few years ago, he said, a jury awarded $365,000 to the survivors of a passenger who experienced five minutes of terror as a damaged plane careened to earth. 
"You're talking about many minutes," the lawyer, James P. Kreindler, said matter-of-factly. "It should be a large award." Maybe $1 million, he said, for the salesman's final anguish. 
Such calculations are being considered by hundreds of lawyers as they measure the potential value of cases of those who lost loved ones at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and in the four hijacked planes. 
The lawyers are asking uncomfortable questions. How much did the dead man make? Was the death fast or slow? Were the passengers terrorized by seeing flight attendants stabbed? How hot was the fire?
For centuries, civil lawsuits have tried to answer such questions in dispassionate economic terms. The main goal of a wrongful death suit is to replace financial support to the dependents of a person whose death was the result of an intentional act or negligence.
In measuring the value of a lost life, lawyers often say that dollars are inadequate, but that they are all there is. In addition to damages for economic losses, intangible things, like the suffering before an inescapable death, are given a price tag. Lawyers say they are struggling to analyze how such intangibles should be computed in the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Mr. Kreindler described the calculations in the salesman's case on the condition that the dead man, newly married and expecting his first child, not be identified. 
Some of the victims are likely to file suits against the airlines and others. Most are expected to file claims for compensation under the fund set up by Congress. 
Either way, lawyers say their calculations based on similar cases in the past are likely to be influential. Mr. Kreindler and an associate, Justin T. Green, said they might try to hire engineers and other experts to reconstruct what those minutes in Windows on the World must have been like.
They might analyze how quickly the fire might have climbed. They might use investigators to track down witnesses who saw people jumping from the building to show the desperation of the trapped people. 
"We want to know exactly what happened in the restaurant," Mr. Green said.
Proving pain and suffering is always a delicate task, Mr. Kreindler said. Jurors or other decision makers must be told enough, but not so much as to feel manipulated. "You want to leave something to their imagination," Mr. Kreindler said.
Other lawyers said the pain and suffering claims based on Sept. 11 present unusual challenges, particularly for applications under the government fund. Many questions about the fund remain unanswered, including what evidence might be accepted.
Some lawyers say the chaos and the vast range of terror experienced by so many people at the trade center make it difficult to assemble the details of many people's final minutes. Jeffrey A. Lichtman, a lawyer who is handling cases involving deaths there, said people on some floors, like those where the planes hit, are presumed to have died instantly, which would mean the law would not recognize any suffering to compensate. 
But people on other floors lived for differing amounts of time and in a range of conditions. Rather than force claimants to prove each pain and suffering case, Mr. Lichtman said, "I will be making the argument that there should be a presumption based upon where you were." 
But some cases, lawyers say, will include detailed accounts. Michel F. Baumeister, a lawyer who is representing clients who lost family members at the trade center and on several of the planes, said cellphone calls will help prove the psychological suffering of those who knew that death was coming.
In one case, Mr. Baumeister said, a co-worker will testify to seeing the man trapped in the trade center as others were escaping. The man also called his wife and said he understood his fate.
It is unclear whether there will be opposing lawyers in the cases filed for compensation under the fund. But some lawyers say hearing officers may be as skeptical of pain and suffering claims as defense lawyers. 
In an air crash case a few years ago a lawyer representing the airline took issue with a claim seeking damages for the suffering of two passengers. The families of the dead men argued that their loved ones must have suffered in the short time after an explosion. But a transcript shows that the airline lawyer, Howard Barwick, suggested that the explosion had killed the men instantly, and argued there there was no suffering to compensate. The tactic worked, Mr. Kreindler said. The award for pain and suffering was zero.
In the salesman's case, Mr. Kreindler said, even a $1 million award for pain and suffering would probably be a tiny fraction of the award because death cases focus mostly on compensating survivors for lost support, the amount the victim would otherwise have provided. 
The salesman was a star at work. At 28, he had been made United States sales director for one company and then had been hired away by another. Early this year, the new company gave him an ownership stake, the title of executive vice president and a salary of about $500,000. 
In court, a lifetime of lost support is typically estimated through the testimony of economists. By analyzing age, salary and other benefits, they project how much a person might be expected to earn over a lifetime.
From that sum is subtracted the amount the person might have spent on things like subway fare or country club dues. 
An economist might persuade a jury, Mr. Kreindler argued, that a hard-driving person like the salesman might work well past 70. It was plausible, he said, to assert that the salesman would have had 40 years ahead of him and that he would have earned more than $500,000 in each of those years. In all, the lawyers concluded, the economic losses might be as much as $25 million. 
Some states award families compensation for their own noneconomic losses, like lost companionship. In its September legislation, Congress said the fund should compensate for such losses, too.
The salesman's case "is a very sympathetic case for noneconomic damages because he never knew his son," said Mr. Green, Mr. Kreindler's associate. Possible noneconomic damages in a court case, the lawyers said: $5 million. The $30 million total they hope for would be among the largest ever in a wrongful death case. It is impossible to say whether any such sum could be recovered.
A few days after the lawyers computed what the salesman's case might bring, another lawyer, Alan L. Fuchsberg, was estimating the value of a case involving another man who died on Sept. 11.
He was 42 and earned $54,000 as a clerk in a financial firm in the World Trade Center.
Mr. Fuchsberg said the clerk's case might bring a substantial award for pain and suffering. The office he worked for was on the 90th floor of the second tower to be hit, where there were announcements encouraging people to return to their desks while the first tower burned.
The clerk, Mr. Fuchsberg said, would have had plenty of time to understand his circumstances. "Obviously," the lawyer said, "it got very smoky and hot and unbearable."
But Mr. Fuchsberg said he told the clerk's father to expect a comparatively small award for economic damages, especially if it was difficult to prove that the clerk, who was single, provided substantial support to his aging parents. Mr. Fuchsberg said some claims for single people with no dependents could be worth as little as $100,000. 
The clerk's father, who asked not to be named, said he was stunned to learn the role a person's income played in lawyers' math. "The value of a life is certainly not determined based on earnings," he said, his voice breaking. "We're talking about my son."

HEADLINE: As Crowds Dwindle, San Franciscans Become Nostalgic for the Missing Tourists 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
The seals were barking up a riot on their favorite pier this afternoon, barking and clapping and all but doing cartwheels as they waited and waited for the tourists and their famous Boudin Bakery sourdough bread. 
 Durson Senel, a salesman at Web Camera, waited and waited for the tourists, too. So did Nir Riesman, next door to Web at King's Fine Art and Antiques. And Maria Elena Palma, next door to King's at Quality Sports souvenirs. And the bakery workers across the road, starring glumly at the too-crowded rows of loaves at Boudin. 
 Everyone at Fisherman's Wharf was waiting, on a day the sun was warm and sweet and the shops should have been crazy busy. "They used to line up and pack the store for these," Mr. Senel said, pointing to the disposable point-and-shoot cameras, $2.99 and up, in a bin outside the front door. "Sometimes," he said with a chuckle, "it was almost a nuisance." 
The throngs of tourists, San Francisco's lifeblood, are gone. Gone from the cable cars and department stores in Union Square, gone from the trendy bars and restaurants in North Beach, gone, like a summer storm, from the city's hilly streets. The decline in tourism began with a softening economy, hit hard after Sept. 11, and dipped even lower last weekend, after Gov. Gray Davis issued a warning of a "credible threat" of terrorists who might try to "destroy" the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges, among others in California.
Governor Davis's warning, say city officials, cause a flurry of canceled reservations at the hotels and restaurants last weekend and turned tourist-dependent sites like Fisherman's Wharf into ghost towns.
"It was the lousiest announcement he ever made," said Mr. Senel, speaking of the governor's warning, which the F.B.I. immediately played down as uncorroborated and this week called "not credible." 
"It was selfish," Mr. Senel went on. "We were over here thinking" -- he glanced at the Golden Gate Bridge in the near horizon -- " 'O.K., is it going to blow now?' "
Though the threat Governor Davis announced -- that terrorists might attack major bridges at rush hour from Nov. 2 to Nov. 7 -- would have been over by now even if it had been credible, it doesn't feel like it's over on or near the Golden Gate Bridge, the city's most visited landmark. The presence of National Guard troops on the bridges, and California Highway Patrolmen riding back and forth across the span, no doubt reassures commuters. But some city officials say that the publicity on all the security, which has been present except for the National Guard since Sept. 11, sends a message to tourists that the bridges are still not safe.
While 82 percent of San Francisco's tourists usually fly here, the city, like others across the country, has been focusing since Sept. 11 on attracting drive-in travelers. "I don't think people are necessarily afraid to fly," said Laurie Armstrong, vice president of the city's convention and visitors bureau. "But people want to stick close to home in case something does happen." City officials were buoyed when Governor Davis came to Fisherman's Wharf early last month to announce a $5 million statewide advertising campaign to induce California residents to travel within the state.
"And then the governor comes out and says the bridges are threatened," Ms. Armstrong said, "and we're looking at each other thinking, 'What's next?' "
She said they hoped that visitors would come back this weekend.
In fact, visitors are straggling in, if not in big numbers or with deep pockets. But San Francisco, which has long relied on its beauty to get by, is having a harder time these days than many cities less dependent on dazzled guests. Tourism, the city's largest revenue-generating industry by far, bringing in $474 million in taxes and fees, is such a large part of the city's $5.2 billion budget, that its drop in just these last two months, coupled with the dot-com crash, may mean close a $100 million shortfall by the end of the fiscal year.
Hotel occupancy in September, the latest month for which figures are available, shows a drop from the same month last year, to 59.4 percent from 88.5 percent. (In the two weeks after Sept. 11, many hotels had occupancy rates in the teens, the worst decline in the nation.) Nearly 3,000 hotel workers have lost their jobs or had their hours cut. It has reached the point where the mayor has created a tourism outreach plan that includes urging people in the state to come to San Francisco by calling them up and inviting them. 
San Franciscans, slightly disdainful of tourists the way residents everywhere are of the camera-toting, souvenir T-shirt-wearing guests who trample their landmarks, are becoming nostalgic for the crowds. "Just two months ago, the lines for the cable cars would be as long as the block," said Michael Dunn, a 56-year-old writer, as he watched people pop into the Powell Street cable car with no wait at all. "It's a little scary," he said. "First, the dot-comers left, and now the tourists."
Ms. Palma of Quality Sports at Fisherman's Wharf, was sitting behind the register with her head in her hands, thinking of the right slogan to bring the tourists back. "The bridges," she said finally, "are not falling down."

HEADLINE: Gambling Law May Mean Salvation for Yonkers Track 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT WORTH 

DATELINE: YONKERS, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Just two months ago, it seemed that nothing could save Yonkers Raceway. The dilapidated harness racing track, once a gambler's Mecca, had been losing money for years, and the 100-acre property just off the Major Deegan Expressway was for sale.
 Now, in a twist that no handicapper could have foreseen, the track may have been granted a reprieve -- by the Sept. 11 terror attack. 
 Last month, the disaster pushed the New York State Legislature to approve the largest expansion of state-run gambling in decades, to help restore its shrinking revenues. If the law survives the expected legal challenges, it will mean video slot machines at Yonkers, which could draw floods of new gamblers and restore the track's bottom line. 
"It's like God intervened for the gamblers," said Ivan Vass, 70, as he sprawled on one of the couches on the second floor of the Yonkers clubhouse, watching a race on television. 
For Mr. Vass and the other retirees who spend their days laying odds and reminiscing in the track's vast, decaying clubhouse 20 minutes north of New York City, the new law could mean better horses, new blood and the kinds of crowds that have not been seen here since the 1960's, when the track drew 40,000 people on weekends, and 25,000 on weeknights. 
"It's like a morgue here sometimes, like a public library," Mr. Vass said, gesturing around at the other customers, nearly all of them gray-haired men like him. "Now they'll finally have the money to fix this place up."
Other customers agreed. "It's going to keep this place open, that's for sure," said Vincent Casucci, 80, as he sat by himself nursing a cup of coffee in the track's cavernous main gallery. "If they get the one-armed bandits in here they can't lose."
In fact, the track's owner, Tim Rooney, said he planned to start renovating the place as soon as possible. He had been trying to sell it, after years of losses and shrinking attendance. The track's grandstand, which once held 15,000 people, was torn down five years ago, and the clubhouse's third and fourth floors are closed. 
In an interview in his office just after the new law was signed, he was all ebullience. "The potential is just spectacular, not just for us, but for the horsemen, the customers, the whole community," he said. 
It is true that the track's sudden good luck appears to owe something to the Sept. 11 attack, he added, a little uncomfortably. But the gambling bill might have passed anyway, he said, given the slumping economy and heavy lobbying by gambling supporters. 
And the good luck may not last. The State Constitution includes stiff restrictions on gambling, and there are sure to be legal challenges from gambling opponents and competitors like Donald J. Trump, who owns casinos in Atlantic City and has long fought an expansion of gambling in New York State. 
But the gamblers here say they have politics on their side for a change: the state needs the money.
The people who would come to Yonkers to play the slot machines might not bet on horses, but tracks would receive 12 to 25 percent of the take from the machines, with the rest going to the state's education fund. The law also requires that 45 percent of the track's profits from the machines go into purses -- the money that goes to the horse breeders, trainers and drivers. 
Mr. Rooney said he expected purses to double soon after he installs the initial round of 2,500 video slot machines.
Mr. Rooney and his son-in-law Robert Galterio, the track's general manager, talked excitedly about plans for a whole new $150 million building to house the machines. "I'd be very upset if we didn't have the machines in by this summer," Mr. Galterio said.
The new law would bring video slot machines to other tracks, including Aqueduct, a thoroughbred raceway in Queens, and it sanctions new Indian-run casinos in the Catskills and western New York. 
But its effects are likely to be most striking at Yonkers. Once the region's biggest gambling venue, the track is now virtually empty on some weeknights, having lost out to television, off-track betting and harness racing's failure to attract a new generation of fans.
Slot machines have already helped to revive dying harness tracks elsewhere in the country. At Dover Downs in Dover, Del., daily purses were about $7,500 six years ago, and after slots were legalized they shot up, reaching about $130,000 today.
If Yonkers has anything like that kind of success, the breeders, trainers and drivers will profit, too. 
"The entire industry will spiral upward instead of downward," said Joe Faraldo, the president of the group that represents the horsemen at Yonkers, who often drives and trains horses here himself. "The horsemen are overjoyed."
The city of Yonkers could benefit as well, said Mayor John Spencer. The track was once the city's second-largest employer and taxpayer, with more than 2,500 employees (not including horsemen and trainers), but it now has only 500. 
One thing is certain: the prospect has warmed the hearts of some aging gamblers.
"It'll bring a lot of new life, and we could certainly use it," said Michael Morgan, a retired tugboat deck hand from the Bronx who has been coming here since the 1950's, as he sat with a friend in the vast gallery, gazing out at the empty track. 
"We may end up broke," he added. "But we'll be happy."

HEADLINE: World Trade Organization Admits China, Amid Doubts 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: DOHA, Qatar, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
China joined the World Trade Organization this evening, completing a quest that required 15 years of haggling over whether the nation's fitful embrace of a market economy entitled it to the full trading rights of capitalist countries.
 Trade ministers from the United States, Europe and India referred to the marathon negotiations over China's admission as difficult, acrimonious and politically charged, but the admission ceremony was brief and cordial. Michael Moore, the organization's director general, hugged Shi Guangsheng, China's trade minister, as a moderator itemized articles of membership and declared, "The ministerial conference so agrees." 
 Chinese officials have presented the nation's membership as one of their most significant diplomatic achievements since China displaced Taiwan and took a seat on the United Nations Security Council in 1971. 
That step decades ago gave China the political rank of the United States and the former Soviet Union. Today's step ensures China equal status for its fast-growing economy, though in return it will have to grant foreign companies access to its 1.3 billion consumers.
World trade ministers have gathered in this Persian Gulf emirate to hammer out an agenda for trade liberalization globally, and China's admission ceremony came on the second of five days of these talks.
Qatari troops in purple camouflage and security guards wearing flowing white robes and kaffiyehs surrounded a complex on the shores of the gulf to protect delegates, who had been warned of potential terrorist action. There were no disruptions.
The discussions are at an early stage, and few were predicting breakthroughs before Tuesday. The goal is to begin a three-year round of negotiations on virtually all aspects of trade, but there is no guarantee that the effort will not fail as it did in Seattle two years ago.
American and European negotiators who strongly advocate trade liberalization showed few signs of having quelled a rebellion by some developing countries. Poorer nations are demanding concessions on trade issues they care about most before agreeing to discuss the demands of their industrial counterparts.
The most divisive issues include an attempt by India and Brazil to allow nations to violate medical patents when public health is at stake, an issue that pits a broad swath of the developing world against the United States. Europe and Japan are under heavy pressure to remove some protections for farmers, a longtime goal of the United States and many poor nations that want to export more farm products.
Murasoli Maran, India's trade minister, said his nation would stand firm against any new round of trade liberalization if its demands are not met. "We will withstand all pressures," he said.
China's accession was greeted by delegates here as an important moment. But many officials say privately that the long-term implications are uncertain. "I believe that as this century unfolds and people look back on this day, they will conclude that in admitting China to the W.T.O. we took a decisive step in shaping a global economic and commercial system," said the American trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick.
He added, however, that the changes China would have to make to comply with international trade rules remain a "daunting challenge." American officials have argued for years that trade commitments will force China to open areas of business that have been closed or restricted, like banking services, agriculture and retail chains. Beijing, they say, will ultimately have to improve its legal system and remove government from day-to-day interference in business affairs.
Whether membership marks a more profound transformation is another question. Some Western experts predict that open trade and freer investment will act as sea water on a wooden pier, weakening the pillars of the Communist Party's power. For its part, China expects to expand the market for its own export industries while maintaining the dichotomy between an open economy and a closed political system.
Anne M. Veneman, the secretary of agriculture, who is here to focus on farm trade, predicted that China's entry could increase American exports by $2 billion annually.
And though Mr. Shi, the trade minister, echoed the trade-wary sentiments of India and other nations, American officials foresee that China's passion for development will make it a solid ally in pushing for trade liberalization in coming years.

HEADLINE: Terror, Not Election Losses, Worries a Governors Group 

BYLINE:  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
When the nation's Republican governors gathered here this weekend for their annual meeting, they put the best face they could on last Tuesday's elections in which Democrats reclaimed the governor's offices in Virginia and New Jersey. And they mostly glossed over the possibility that Democrats might lengthen their victory string next year when 36 more governor's races are held, races in which more Republican than Democratic seats will be at risk.
 But there was no glossing over when the 16 governors who showed up -- there are 29 Republican governors in all -- took up the first two issues on their agenda: terrorism on the rise and an economy in decline. 
 They spoke of unemployment rates that have increased by a third or more in recent months, especially since Sept. 11, with the outlook for things to get worse before getting better. They told of state budgets that have slipped close to or into the red, requiring special legislative sessions to make painful adjustments. 
The governors recounted how they had been struggling to come up with plans to thwart terrorism attacks or to respond to attacks they might fail to thwart -- "not plans to handle things like fires or floods or stuff we already know how to handle, and handle well," said Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, "but things we've never, ever had to handle, and nobody else either, like anthrax and smallpox."
They asked the federal authorities to share more intelligence about terrorist threats with them to help them improve antiterror planning. They called for better coordination of federal, state and local public safety efforts, arguing that ultimately state and local defense was not up to the federal government or the Pentagon but was the responsibility of state and local authorities.
And sometimes they vented frustration. Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, having heard talk about the rounding up, jailing and trial of terrorists, grabbed a microphone and blurted:
"We're in a war, with people who want to kill us. And somehow we're still taking about 'arresting' them and 'bringing them to justice.' I don't get it. We need to kill them until the rest surrender. No lawyers and no courts. Then we need to capture their leaders. We can try them -- and then kill them."
Governors applauded.
The governors mostly chose to see the Democratic wins in Virginia and New Jersey as aberrations -- victories over struggling, lesser-known, out-spent Republican candidates by Democrats who often sounded like Republicans as they ran.
"I'm not sure there is anything more to it than that, no great themes," said Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut.
As for next year's races, the governors insisted, by and large, that there was no need to worry so long as President Bush's approval rating stayed up and the economy did not collapse and as long as progress was made in the war.
But several Republican consultants and pollsters who briefed the governors warned against relying on President Bush's popularity.
"His big numbers don't necessarily mean that you're safe, don't necessarily provide a protective umbrella," said Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies group.
Mike Murphy of Murphy, Pintak, Gautier and Hudrome, recalled that in the 1942 elections after the Pearl Harbor attacks, Democrats lost many seats in Congress despite President Franklin D. Roosevelt's huge personal popularity.
"It's one thing to rally around the president and something else to rally around a party," Mr. Murphy said. "We've got to work on our own message."
Despite such warnings, the governors remained upbeat about 2002.
"We think we are in quite good shape," said Gov. James S. Gilmore 3rd of Virginia.
Mr. Gilmore also is Republican national chairman, a job he may lose given Tuesday's losses. But little criticism of him was voiced here, and some colleagues went out of their way to defend him.
"He's our best fund-raiser, none better," said Gov. John Hoeven of North Dakota. "We need to keep him around."

HEADLINE: Perspective; 
Reader Responses Continue to Pour Through the Yankee Floodgate

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
We have surely moved on. Or have we? The First Fan, by staging a late-inning rally in the New York mayor's race, managed to keep a hated opponent from winning the championship. Yankee management, avoiding the sentimentality it demands only of fans, began the human pruning, weeding and replanting process that will transform the greatest team of our time into the greatest team of some other time. Baseball itself will abandon its traditional premise of being a pastime with a civic subtext by closing down money-losing teams. 
 Yet, traffic to thelipsite@aol.com shows no signs of slowing down. Not wanting to strand e-mailers on the cyber paths, this is not only a sequel to last Wednesday's roundup of responses to last Sunday's "Hate the Yankees? This Harangue Is for You," but a further exploration of a remarkably passionate and thoughtful fandom around the country. 
 One measure of the impact of the Yankees-Arizona World Series is that the jokes have started circulating.
Bob Nathan of Colorado sends the one about the New York first-grade teacher who asks her class to raise their hands if they, too, are Yankees fans. All do except for one little girl who explains that she is a Diamondbacks fan, as are her mom and dad. 
The teacher says: "That's no reason. What if your mom and dad were morons, what would you be then?"
"Then," replied the little girl, "we'd be Yankee fans."
These are, of course, recycled jokes from other teams in other times, but jokes directed at the Yankees have been few and far between. As respondents have pointed out, making jokes about a team with the soul of a General Electric or Citibank is like kicking a steel vault with Jell-O boots. Could attitudes be changing? 
A local Mets e-mail cell has been crackling with missives from Greg Prince, known as the Bard of the Yard, whose post-Series effort was an Onion-like news story in which a somewhat cranky God wondered why Paul O'Neill had to break so many sporting goods and why Joe Torre's sister, the nun, didn't pray for more important things than baseball games. He also declared that despite years of earthly hype, there were no Yankees up where He lived.
The Big Manager added: "You know, I haven't always had the best of luck with serpents and the like. But in this case, I think the snakes worked out just fine."
But the laughter becomes hollow when the truth sinks in. Perhaps in the same pragmatic spirit in which Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a longtime Yankee fan, singled home Michael Bloomberg, who had spent more than $50 million on his election campaign, George Steinbrenner, General Manager Brian Cashman and Manager Joe Torre will discard old players and buy new ones in the best use of a $120 million payroll.
Andrew Sollinger nailed it when he wrote: "The Bomber Bullies were miscast as heroic underdogs, an uncomfortable role for a club designed and continually redesigned like some scientific free-agent experiment run amok -- Steinbrenner does Frankenstein. When it comes to World Series Game 7's, professionalism, poise and pride take a backseat to heart, which makes believers out of both players and fans."
As seems often the case, some of the most pointed messages come from Boston. It is not clear if this is because Boston is America's Athens or because Red Sox fans have been fine-tuned by suffering.
Bob Dame, who says he has been a Red Sox fan since he was 3 years old, writes: "When the Red Sox lost Game 7 in '67, '75, and '86, it was a CHOKE, pure pain, second-guessing and hand-wringing. But the Yankees and their fans are not at all humbled: 'We will sign Jason Giambi, and all is well.' "
Giambi, Oakland's power-hitting first baseman, is expected to be courted by the Yankees (Bye-bye and thanks, Tino Martinez). 
Dr. Richard D. Ginsburg of Boston writes: "I am confused by your harangue because you do such a great job of explaining what is so detestable about the mindless sport fanatic and yet miss the reason why the Yankees are resented. Fans yearn for a return to purity in sports. While the Yankees have a great team, their image also reflects what has gone wrong in sports. What the Yankees have done in this World Series is outstanding, and our country recovered a bit from the character they showed right 'til the very end. But, as long as Steinbrenner and the rest of the team owners continue to play the money game, teams like the Yankees will always be resented."
The "money game" has just begun. Deeming certain cities unworthy of having a major league franchise because of their revenue stream is an economic, moral and symbolic action that will be debated on many levels for some time to come.
On the human level of a fan, please listen to Randy Henrick, who writes: "My team, the Expos, are going to be folded today. That's a tragedy. It would make a better statement to our society and the world to fold the Yankees and save the Expos. I also don't buy into the nonsense about the Yankees being America's team after Sept. 11. Better for the world to see the worst of America, as represented by the Yankees and their hooligan fans, fail in the end. That shows there is hope for us all and, in the end, that good can sometimes triumph over evil, at least metaphorically speaking.
"I had honestly hoped they," Henrick continues, referring to his Expos, "would relocate to Washington so I could continue my passion in a not-too-distant venue. I feel like I have lost a close family member and a part of myself. There is a great void in my life. Major league baseball enticed and teased my passion, energies and life milestones for 33 years and now casts me (and my fellow Expos fans) aside without even so much as an apology or a chance to even say goodbye. Someone should sue."

HEADLINE: Global Warming Impasse Is Broken 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
After four grinding years of negotiations, the final details of a pioneering treaty aimed at fighting global warming emerged from talks in Morocco yesterday, and many large industrial countries, excepting the United States, said they were likely to ratify the agreement.
 If enacted, and significant hurdles still must be crossed for that to happen, the treaty, called the Kyoto Protocol, would set the first binding restrictions on releases of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases by industrial countries. 
 President Bush rejected the treaty in March, limiting its reach by putting the United States, the largest source of such gases, on the sidelines. At the time, the decision caused some other countries, most notably Japan, Canada, Russia and Australia, to hesitate. 
But after two weeks of discussions in Marrakesh among this group, along with developing countries and the European Union, the treaty's strongest proponent, agreement was reached on a set of compromises. 
"The Kyoto Protocol is saved," Olivier DeLeuze, head of the delegation from the European Union, said after the deal was announced. 
Negotiations were far tougher than those producing every other past international environmental treaty, officials of many governments said, because cuts in these emissions will come mainly from restricting the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels, the underpinning of industrial economies.
The industrial countries that sign on will be required, as a group, to cut emissions by 2012 to levels about 5 percent below emissions levels in 1990. That shared target will be easier to achieve, in part, because Russia and some other countries, after the collapse of Communism, saw emissions drop far below 1990 levels. 
As happens to most international agreements, the treaty lost some of its initial vision over years of negotiation between blocs of countries that would be affected differently by its terms. For example, Russia, Canada and Japan sought and gained substantial credit toward their gas targets for the ability of their forests to absorb carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. 
In telephone interviews yesterday, American officials at the meeting gave no sign that the Bush administration would reconsider joining the effort. "Other countries have chosen their path, and our answer is still no," said a senior member of the American delegation.
Some of Mr. Bush's critics in the Senate, most notably James M. Jeffords of Vermont, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, criticized the administration's lack of an alternative to the treaty. He said that Washington "refuses to take responsibility for its share of the problem."
Most climate scientists say that a buildup of greenhouse gases has caused at least part of the world's warming trend that could lead to droughts, floods and agricultural disruption.
Mr. Bush has said that the Kyoto pact could harm the American economy and was unfair because developing countries like China and India were excused from any obligations to make emissions cuts.
In a statement delivered at the closing ceremonies, Paula J. Dobriansky, the under secretary of state for global affairs, said the Bush administration was still committed to solving the problem, but in its own way and at its own pace. "Climate change is a serious issue that requires real action," she said. 
Nonetheless, the completion of the treaty -- even without the United States and with various compromises -- still represented an important moment in industrial history, environment experts said. 
After a century of growing use of fossil fuels with little regard for the impacts of a steady buildup of greenhouse gases, many experts said, this is the first global mechanism for limiting such environmental harm. 
"It's by far the strongest environmental treaty that's ever been drafted, from the beginning to the end, from the soup of measuring emissions to the nuts of the compliance regime," said David D. Doniger, the director of climate programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental group. 
"The parties have reached complete agreement on what's an infraction, how you decide a case and what are the penalties," said Mr. Doniger, who attended the meeting. "That's as good as it gets in international relations."
Another innovation in the treaty is its unfettered trading mechanism for greenhouse-gas emissions. Until last summer, the European Union, driven by strong public sentiment, had staunchly opposed allowing a country to get credit towards its emissions targets by investing in cheaper pollution cleanup projects overseas. 
But under pressure from Japan, Canada and Russia, that opposition faded in Marrakesh, negotiators said. The goal of such trading is to foster international markets for energy-efficient technologies, treaty supporters said. 
"The Marrakesh results send a clear signal to business, local governments and the general public that climate-friendly products, services and activities will be rewarded," said Michael Zammit-Cutajar, a United Nations official.
To gain legal force, the treaty must be ratified by at least 55 countries, including a group responsible for at least 55 percent of the heat-trapping emissions from industrial countries in 1990. With the United States out, that threshold can be achieved only with the support of both Japan and Russia. 
Russia gave strong signals yesterday that it was satisfied. In a statement made before the meeting closed, Aleksandr I. Bedritsky, the lead negotiator from Russia, said the agreement "opens the path for the ratification by all countries, including the Russian Federation."
Representatives of Japan, where industries are fighting the pact, were more circumspect. That hesitation is natural because Japan -- under the arithmetic of the treaty -- will have to make significant cuts in emissions domestically to reach its target, said Dr. Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
Europe is in a better position to meet its targets because it benefits from the large cuts in emissions that already occurred in Britain and Germany for economic, not environmental, reasons. The Europeans took credit in Marrakesh for leading on the issue. 
Many officials at the meeting said that Mr. Bush, who is dedicated to building and maintaining an alliance against terrorism, was missing an opportunity to seek an international approach to the environment. 
Dr. Schmalensee said the main benefit of the treaty was not the modest cuts in emissions it set, but the mechanisms and institutions it would create. "It'll build some engagement and the habit of compliance," he said. "This is a first step."

Hard Times at Yale, Where the Peace Corps Has a Waiting List

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
YALE students are the best and brightest, they go full throttle at whatever they do, and lately, seniors have excelled at worrying. "Everyone's gossiping in the dining halls," says Bethany Lacina. "You hear stuff like Salomon Smith Barney hired hundreds last year, but they're only taking 40 in the whole country this time. Who knows if it's true. But it's preying on everyone's mind."
 "Even getting an interview was hard this year," said Andrew Whealy. Two summers ago, as a sophomore, he had an investment banking internship, and last summer, with the flush economy, figured he could take a break, working odd jobs at Yellowstone park. "Now," he says, "People who took internships last summer are first in line ahead of me." Worried? "Not totally, not yet." He had put on a suit and was browsing the booths at the Yale job fair on Friday. "I notice students are looking for financial stability and safety, like the Peace Corps and C.I.A." 
 Indeed, federal recruiters -- Faith Tagg of the Peace Corps, Amy Mechur of the Federal Reserve Board and Bryan ("no last name please") of the C.I.A. -- were swamped. "I've got something for you; you'll love this," Agent Bryan cheerfully told visitors, handing out free C.I.A. mugs, C.I.A. pens and C.I.A. paperweights. Jittery seniors carried around stacks of employment brochures in their handsome C.I.A. shopping bags. Agent Bryan assured students they didn't have to be language experts to have a bright future at the C.I.A. "Liberal arts majors are a perfect fit," he said. "We need people doing background checks on new employees. We're looking for self-starters, good writers, people with common sense."
A year ago Ms. Tagg would have been delighted to find a couple of Peace Corps candidates here. Thursday she did 13 interviews and had to put four on a waiting list. Students like Rebecca Jaffe are as intense about the Peace Corps as they would be about Goldman Sachs. Ms. Jaffe dressed formally. "You want to make a good impression," she said. "I was the first interview. I'm willing to leave whenever. I'll take any post. I've traveled to Africa, done Outward Bound, slept on rocks. I think with my experience I stand a decent chance."
These seniors were 12 during America's last recession, but are fast learners and were adapting to a rotten job market. Nearly twice as many attended Yale's two job fairs this fall as last year. Erin Johanson had waited too long and spots for a C.I.A. campus interview were filled. So he went to the fair in a suit ("always better to be a little overdressed") and met Agent Bryan. "He was very friendly," said the senior.
MS. MECHUR, 23, an economics major who graduated in June and returned Friday as a job recruiter, felt like Yale Van Winkle. "It's amazing how everything's changed for these seniors," she said. In September 2000, at the start of her senior year, "I already had offers exploding. That fall I had six offers. No, 10. Actually, might have been 12." Investment banking firms offered $55,000 base pay and a signing bonus of $10,000, and said her year-end bonus could be 115 percent of base pay, a $128,250 total. Not surprisingly, 150 of 1,300 seniors last year took Wall Street jobs. Ms. Mechur was that rare business major to turn down big bucks and choose a Federal Reserve Board job for the policy experience. Friday, seniors visited her booth nonstop. "The pay's not bad," she said. "Almost $40,000 a year." Recruiters sounded giddy. "We're enthralled by the talent here," said Agent Bryan, handing out another C.I.A. mug and shopping bag.
Marie Sorensen, an anthropology and art major, took advantage of the boom economy's fluidity when she graduated in June 2000, working a summer job in photography, traveling to Europe, getting work with a temp agency for $21 an hour and returning to Europe. It was like playing musical chairs, and every time she won. Then, just as she was ready for a permanent job, came Sept. 11. For the first time in her life, there was no chair when the music stopped. She moved back with her parents and went to a headhunting firm, but found she wasn't treated like a Yalie. "The guy asked if I'd take a position as an admin -- a secretary! I said you wouldn't offer that to a 23-year-old Yale man. I've been reading this book for women, about how to get treated with respect in the workplace. They talk about doing down your makeup, dressing conservative so you don't get stereotyped. They think I'm some attractive little Yale arts girl, but they'll see. I'm learning, I'm going to baffle the hell out of them."

 They made up the language of the fiscal crisis, those words, and they are echoing again around New York, recalling that tough time in the mid-1970's when, after years of free spending and fiscal irresponsibility, New York City approached bankruptcy. It stayed afloat, with help from banks, the state, fiscal monitors, municipal unions and a kicking-and-screaming Washington. But though the crisis transformed the city's politics and financial practices, its people felt its ill effects for at least a generation. 
 Nobody is worried about bankruptcy today, but the slowing economy, the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the impact of Sept. 11 have raised the specter of the city's enduring another period of austerity, a return to the days of dirtier streets, legions of the homeless, an increase in the welfare population, a rise in crime, a plummet in the quality of life so sharp that people fled town. 
Those days seem so distant. Could they come back? Are there legitimate parallels to be drawn?
Comparisons are elusive. The experts say that New York City is in for a difficult time because of the ripple effect of a troubled economy and the terrorist attack. Tourism is down, businesses that were forced out of town may not want to return and unemployment is growing, with economists predicting a loss of about 100,000 jobs in the next fiscal year. For a comparison, the city lost more than 600,000 jobs from 1969 to 1975.
If the trend does not reverse itself, the numbers could represent serious trouble. There is another kind of trouble, more psychological in nature. Fear of crime and impatience with bad services drove people away in the 1970's. Today the city is coping with a broader fear, of being a target of international terrorism. How does it even begin to address that, other than with bravado and clever television commercials starring pretend ice skater Woody Allen? 
All that means less economic activity, lower tax revenues, less money in the city and state coffers. Combined with the recession, the picture worries some experts, even factoring in federal help to rebuild the attack site. "I think the financial and economic problems the city has are potentially as severe as in the mid- 1970's," warned Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller.
Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier who led the fiscal rescue effort in the 1970's, agrees and then some, because of the national recession. "I think the financial problems are going to be much greater than in the 1970's," he said.
The consensus: as bad or worse economically. But -- and this is a big but -- against a very different backdrop. The city's underlying fiscal health is good. It could be better. It still has a lot of debt because of borrowing -- legitimate borrowing, not 1970's style -- but too much of it, Mr. Hevesi has warned repeatedly. Nearly 19 cents of every tax dollar goes to debt service. And the city would be in a better position if Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had not spent surpluses generated by the flush years, but instead saved them for a rainy day. 
The city still has one of the most sophisticated and respected budget processes in the country. There is almost no parallel to the mess of the fiscal crisis, when critics who compared City Hall to a candy store could not be accused of exaggerating. For a long time, nobody, including Mayor Abraham D. Beame, even knew how big the city's work force was. Today, updated "head counts" are published in reports and on several official city Web sites.
Then, whenever anyone cried poverty, money would inevitably appear as if by magic; the magic turned out to be borrowing against next year's revenues to pay off this year's debts, again and again and again until the city was barred from the financial markets. Today its bonds and notes are considered good investments. Then the city was able to dig out only with the help of the governor, bankers, fiscal monitors, Washington and its own unions. 
Mr. Beame became a ceremonial mayor -- inconceivable today. Mayors of New York are now international celebrities, as they were even before Sept. 11. "The federal government used to view New York City's problems as a result of its own mismanagement and was unsympathetic," said Abraham Biderman, a city finance commissioner in the 1980's. "Now everyone understands its problems are not of its own making." 
Washington, the city's harshest critic then, is sympathetic now. That stands to help.
But the city will still have to cut services deeply and quickly. Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg has ruled out raising taxes, which he argues would be counterproductive, and the city faces a budget gap of at least $4 billion in the fiscal year that starts July 1. That represents about 12 percent of the city dollars in the budget, compared with a gap of 18 percent in the height of the fiscal crisis, according to the Citizens Budget Commission.
Under the law, the city is supposed to balance its budget within each fiscal year, though given the emergency, the state gave the city a little flexibility: immediately after the attack, the state authorized the city to sell up to $2.5 billion in short-term bonds, to help it recover from the disaster as it awaited federal help. So far, $1 billion worth of those bonds have been sold, and they do not have to be repaid until next October. 
The Giuliani administration is already cutting spending and Mr. Bloomberg will have to go further, making significant cuts, and in very few services since it is probably politically impossible to reduce the number of firefighters, police officers or teachers. That argues for a broad strategy, Mr. Bloomberg said on Friday, involving all of the city's unions, whose 250,325 members -- 14,500 more than when Mr. Giuliani took office -- account for half of the $40 billion budget. 
"Nobody is going to solve the city's fiscal problems without the municipal workers, through their unions and pension funds being part of that process," Mr. Bloomberg said.
He was not specific, but the possibilities are neither new nor complicated: reducing the work force through hiring freezes, and through early retirements and severance packages that would be partially financed with pension fund money. That would take the cooperation of the union leaders, who would have to be convinced that a cooperative deal was in the interest of their members. The unions and their pension funds played a central role during the fiscal crisis, but then the alternative was bankruptcy. 
Making workers more productive could save money, too, an elusive goal for decades. Other possibilities are limited, as Mr. Bloomberg noted at a news conference Friday. "In the 1970's, we had an expense problem; expenses were out of control. Right now we have a revenue problem," he said. "Both lead to deficits. The option of cutting things is less today maybe than then, or maybe it will be more painful."
Options are few in part because the city learned from its mistakes and cannot, New Yorkers may fervently hope, repeat them. For instance, it deferred maintenance of its bridges, let them rust and rot so badly that some, the Williamsburg Bridge in particular, became a health hazard and cost the city a fortune over the years. 
In a way, as victim of its own success, the more disciplined city has less bloat to cut today. In the 1970's it relied on strategies it cannot use again, like having the state take over some city responsibilities.
That is very unlikely to happen again. Nor is anyone anticipating the kind of broad mobilization that saved the city during the fiscal crisis. Mr. Rohatyn strongly advises short-term federal assistance to cities and states. He argues that the city, hit by both the recession and terrorists, cannot can go it alone.
The numbers strongly suggest that he is right, that while this is not 1975, it is not the healthiest of times, either. But though Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki want substantial federal aid to rebuild, so far they see budget balancing as a local job.
That lack of a crisis atmosphere is the most dramatic contrast with the 1970's, but the city's leaders are hardly in denial.
"I think we have to be realistic and face the facts that it's going to be tough times for a year or two," Mr. Bloomberg said. "We are going to have to make some tough choices."

Call It What It Is: Subtraction

BYLINE:  By DAVE ANDERSON 

 BODY:
THE new buzzword in baseball is contraction, as in the folding of two franchises. But what the owners want to do is really subtraction. In any math class, 2 from 30 has always been subtraction, not contraction.
 Then again, baseball owners have never had high marks in math or finance. Or judgment. 
 Until free agency was thrust upon them a quarter of a century ago, the owners thought that they, not the players, were entitled to most of the money. And by then it was too late.
Until the players' contracts soared into the millions, the owners never thought about a salary cap. And by then it was too late.
Until some clubs were struggling to survive financially while some clubs, notably the Yankees, were collecting multimultimillions from cable television, the owners never thought about revenue-sharing. And by then it was too late.
Baseball's owners, who expect taxpayers to vote to fund their new stadiums, also have never had high marks in fan-friendliness.
Less than 48 hours after an unforgettable Game 7 in an unforgettable World Series that, according to the television ratings, charmed not just Arizona and New York but the entire nation, Commissioner Bud Selig dropped "contraction" into baseball's vocabulary. With a thud.
Just when baseball at its best was fun again, just when even the most bitter fans had seemed to forget the 1994 lockout that canceled that year's World Series, the owners' vote to subtract two franchises, probably Montreal and Minnesota, took all the fun out of it. Again.
The owners don't seem to understand that their management system is what needs to be eliminated, not two franchises.
The owners' arrogance also needs to be eliminated. Selig talked about lopping off two franchises without ever talking to the players' union about it just when the already difficult negotiations for a new collective-bargaining agreement are about to begin.
You would think that instead of alienating the union on the eve of negotiations, Selig and the owners would try to create at least a cordial relationship by informing the union about the plans for subtraction.
The union's role would involve the method of dispersement of most of the 50 players on the two teams to the other clubs, presumably in a draft in the inverted order of the standings in the recent season. The two teams' minor league players would also be affected.
In their arrogance, the owners have yet to realize, with some utility infielders making millions, that baseball's players union is the most powerful in sports.
The owners have only themselves to blame for the union's muscle. With two or three owners always willing to ante up more and more millions for Alex Rodriguez last year or for Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi this year, salaries keep soaring higher and higher. Maybe the current economy will subdue this year's free-agent auctions somewhat, but probably not much.
For all practical purposes, baseball's management system is really baseball's management chaos.
In pro football and pro basketball, a salary cap has maintained some sense of order among the multimillion contracts. But baseball's union is too strong to allow the owners any semblance of order. The owners' only solution is revenue-sharing. Without it, more subtraction is inevitable. Two more franchises in a year or two, two more franchises in four or five years.
Revenue-sharing is why the N.F.L. is so healthy even with a salary cap. Without each team sharing equally for four decades from what is now a billion-dollar television contract, the Green Bay Packers franchise would be somewhere else or nowhere else. Several other franchises would be gone, too. Instead, the Packers not only live, they thrive.
But until the Yankees and baseball's other big-market franchises agree to share at least some of the wealth with the small-market franchises, the small-market franchises will suffer. And more will die.
The Expos have had several blue-chip players, like Pedro Martinez and Moises Alou, but let them depart as free agents because the club couldn't afford to pay them anywhere near market value. Year by year, the Expos, who were leading the National League East before the 1994 lockout, got worse and worse, eventually disillusioning whatever baseball fans Montreal had.
Even so, the Expos franchise could be moved to, say, northern Virginia rather than subtracted.
Minnesota is different. Unlike the Expos, the Twins franchise, which originated in Washington a century ago, has a rich history. It won the World Series as recently as 1991. It has Hall of Fame names: Walter Johnson, Harmon Killebrew, Rod Carew, Kirby Puckett. With revenue-sharing, it would be able to endure the way the Packers have in pro football.
Instead, the owners plan to subtract both the Twins and the Expos. In a year or two, they'll subtract, say, Florida and Tampa Bay. That's baseball's idea of progress.

Bitter Rivalry Endures in Cozy Setting

BYLINE:  By JOE DRAPE 

 BODY:
The conversation was silenced now that the 116th meeting of Williams and Amherst was in overtime with the Ephs and the Lord Jeffs knotted, 17-17. They were deadly serious in the corner of this East Side bar. Kevin Kelly, a psychiatrist and 1972 Williams graduate, studied the big screen with practiced concentration.
 Wedged against the wall, John Marion, Amherst class of '55 and a manufacturing executive, straightened his purple Lord Jeffs' sweatshirt and tugged the bill of his matching cap. One bar stool down, Robin Paul, who graduated from Williams in 1999 with majors in economics and philosophy but now plays a cheerleader on the television series "Ed," banged her hand on the mahogany, imploring the Ephs defense. 
 Forget Texas-Oklahoma, Alabama-Auburn or Michigan-Ohio State, The Biggest Little Game in America was about to turn the aptly named barroom Ship of Fools into a room full of either heartbroken or ecstatic football fools.
Kevin Drakeford worried about what he called the script, which he first experienced as an Amherst running back in the early 90's and now seems to roll in a continuous loop: the Lord Jeffs grab a halftime lead, only to relinquish it in the second half.
"I've been heartbroken so many times that I know I can't count on us holding on," confided Drakeford, a financial consultant. He said this despite Amherst's 17-7 halftime lead, which had the hundred or so Lord Jeff fans slinging their beers in a barroom crowded with another 50 or so Ephs fans. "You got to go back to Yogi Berra: 'It ain't over till it's over.' "
It is complicated to explain how a couple of New England Division III teams with nonscholarship players can turn out a couple of hundred "Deeee-fense" chanting alumni for a civilized barroom brawl, not only in Manhattan but in more than 50 sites ranging from Atlanta to Hong Kong.
But a couple of fun facts might help. 
Williams College, which played host to yesterday's game at Weston Field in Williamstown, Mass., was founded in 1793 and named for Colonel Ephraim Williams (thus the nickname Ephs, pronounced EE-fs). Amherst was born when Zephaniah Swift Moore, Williams's second president, left and created the college on the other side of the Berkshires. The first building at Amherst is a direct copy of the first building at Williams, earning forever the enmity of the Williamstown faithful that still call them The Defectors.
Each school boasts famous alumni from on and off the gridiron. Williams sent Jack Maitland to the Baltimore Colts; Amherst sent Doug Swift to the Miami Dolphins. Each counts a United States president among its graduates, James Garfield for Williams and Calvin Coolidge for Amherst.
During yesterday's telecast at the bar, partisans for both schools were reminded of a recent product of the rivalry: George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees. In 1951, Steinbrenner, then the sports editor for the Williams student newspaper, predicted an Ephs rout of the Lord Jeffs. He was right as Williams won, 40-7.
"You are indoctrinated into a hatred for Williams," said Cam Hicks, a 1995 Amherst graduate now working on Wall Street.
This bitterness cuts both ways, especially for the current and the former football players. Mike Osnato was a wide receiver for the Ephs until his graduation in 1994. He arrived at the Ship of Fools early for prime seating and explained some of the traditions. One of them is the address given during the week of the big game by the longtime Williams assistant coach and administrator Renzie Lamb.
The preamble may vary year to year, but Lamb's crescendo is virtually the same. It goes something like this: "If you wish to be happy for an hour, get intoxicated. If you wish to be happy for three days, get married. If you wish to be happy for eight days, kill your pig and eat it. If you wish to be happy forever, beat Amherst."
The one tradition Osnato wanted desperately repeated as Williams tried to finish off the Lord Jeffs in overtime was The Walk. It occurs only after Williams defeats Amherst and entails the Ephs marching up Williamstown's Spring Street, in full pads, helmets on, to a local barbershop. Once there, the shades are pulled as members of the team light cigars, pop beers, sing fight songs and, well, watch a teammate or two get their head shaved. "Especially for seniors, it's the best way to end your career" said Osnato, a Manhattan attorney.
Fortunately for Osnato, Williams running back Tyler Shea made The Walk possible when he bowled over the goal line to give the Ephs a 23-20 overtime victory. It left Drakeford muttering once more about The Script. It turned Paul into the cheerleader she plays on television. It sent Marion out the door onto Second Avenue.
"Congratulations," he said to his bar mates. "See you next year."

Forget the World; Fight Contraction

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
THE United States is at war and Major League Baseball says it will eliminate two sickly teams and politicians around the country have begun to cry out against the owners' proposed euthanasia. It is so heartening to know that our nation has grasped the lessons of Sept. 11 and has all its priorities in working order.
 Just two months ago, we were in heated debate about baseball's mere place in our sudden crisis culture, grappling with our guilt for even caring about when the season should resume and El Duque's condition and the long nights of the postseason to come. Are there any fewer people missing or dead? Is the country less jittery after the anthrax attacks? Are the increasing odds of a ground-troops buildup in Afghanistan bringing more comfort for the coming cold winter? 
 Forget all that. Forget whether airport security workers should become federal workers with standardized training and decent pay. Forget how and if the economy can be invigorated. Forget rising unemployment and shelved issues like education, Social Security and health care. Let's have a sit-in and chant defiantly in support of the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins.
"This unprecedented decision is bad for the fans, bad for the players on the field and the workers and businesses at and around the stadium, bad for the minor league teams that will also be cut loose, and bad for the cities that will be forced into new and more costly bidding wars to avoid being dumped by baseball," complained John Conyers, a Michigan congressman and the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. "This is like a game of musical chairs -- two teams will be left standing and fans will be left out in the cold."
Actually, baseball's move to contract is more about the folding of broken chairs and a conceptual admission that professional sports is subject to the same economic cycles as the rest of the country and that its long era of unrestrained growth is over.
Unlike major league players, most fans are not holding guaranteed contracts worth millions of dollars. Most fans work for companies shredding jobs at a rate that makes the baseball owners look like labor leaders for trying to contract by only two. Where are these politicians who now threaten baseball's antitrust exemption when one of our humanist corporations lays off 10,000 "fans" to protect itself on the stock exchange?
On whose side have they generally been during the era of expansion when public money that could have been used to rebuild schools went for new stadiums whether or not the fans voted to use public tax dollars? The sad truth is that when government mixes with professional sports, "fans" are seldom a consideration. Self-interest prevails. 
As Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, claims to have recently told Commissioner Bud Selig, "I don't much care what you do, but don't you try to shut down the baseball team in Minnesota or you're going to have a huge problem with me." Be his guest, in other words. Dump the Florida Marlins. Their fans will never cost him an election.
It is, of course, a myth that politicians are held accountable for the disappearance of a sports franchise. New Yorkers couldn't tell you who the mayor was when the Dodgers and Giants left town. Had the Yankees bolted for New Jersey on Rudy Giuliani's watch, believe me, we would have had no problem fingering the culprit. 
Politicians typically use their local teams to promote themselves for the same reason celebrities pull strings to get those camera-friendly courtside seats at Madison Square Garden. Sports have become a cheap cliche, a device to cast oneself as part of the crowd, as the average guy on the street. Once again, where were the politicians all these years while Joe Fan was being squeezed out of the ballparks and arenas, or up to the nose-bleed sections, to make room for the shrimp-eaters in the luxury suites? Where is the alarm when the games disappear from free television, or when the owner becomes the broadcaster, and the earning synergy grossly inflates your monthly cable bill?
Understandably, Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat, has to express outrage over the potential folding of the Twins. But when he tells the owners, "You might get people angry enough and lose the exemption," which people is he talking about? The few thousand in French-speaking Quebec who still remember the difference between hits, runs and errors? For every fan in Montreal and Minnesota who may have to mourn the loss of major-league baseball, there are at least tens of thousands in every remaining city who will rejoice at not having to pay wallet-emptying prices to watch minor-league pushovers pose as major-league teams.
Contracting by two won't solve baseball's competition and credibility gap and it surely won't expedite a collective bargaining agreement with the intractable players' union. But it's about time someone stood up and admitted that as an industry, sports has become a bloated festival of greed, all principals included, at the expense of the fan.
From baseball to bowl games, sports have become overdone and overindulged. Contraction was bound to begin somewhere. My advice to the politicians is to not get too bothered by the economics of our relatively sound industry of escapism. Go figure out a way to save the airline industry and the Postal Service.

Negotiators Finish Details Of Pioneering Climate Pact
The final details of the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty aimed at fighting global warming by restricting releases by industrialized countries of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases, emerged from talks in Morocco. Many large industrial countries said they were likely to ratify the agreement, including Japan, Canada, Russia, and Australia, which had hesitated after President Bush rejected the treaty last March. A8

Australian Leader Re-elected
Prime Minister John Howard, who took a hard-line stance against illegal immigration and emphasized his support for the American-led war against terrorism, won a third term in national elections that focused on security and immigration issues. His Liberal Party won 67 seats of 150 seats in Parliament; the rival Labor Party won 65 seats. A15

Somalia Faces Terror Charges
Somalia's weak government has vowed to root out terrorism and says it takes seriously American allegations that fundamentalists inside Somalia have aided Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. Still, the country is not persuaded that its struggling citizens are secretly planning attacks against the United States. A3

Details on Peru Spy Chief
The Bush administration may soon disclose secret details of the relationship between the Central Intelligence Agency and Peru's powerful former spy chief, Vladimiro L. Montesinos, after President Alejandro Toledo requested their release. Mr. Montesinos remains a threat to Peru's fledgling democracy, Mr. Toledo said in an interview. A4

Shadow of 70's Crisis Hangs Over City Again
A combination of the slowing economy, the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the impact of the attacks on the World Trade Center has raised the specter of New York City enduring another period of austerity much like that of the 1970's, though comparisons are elusive. A1

City Will Drop Charges
Charges against all but one of the firefighters arrested during a raucous demonstration at ground zero on Nov. 2 will be dropped, city officials said, in a gesture to help restore the close relationship forged between police officers and firefighters in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. The move comes in the midst of a continuing struggle between firefighters and the city over how many firefighters should be permitted at the World Trade Center site to help search for the remains of their colleagues, 343 of whom died in the disaster.

In the Aftermath of Terror, Grab a Calculator and Tally Forth

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
MEASURING the impact of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon has become a relentless exercise among economists, politicians, journalists, historians and everyday people. In its simplest terms, taking numeric stock of damages and changes is the necessary stuff of recovery --the basis for making decisions on the allocation of funds, the adjustment of interest rates, or at a more mundane level, whether to take that holiday trip to the Big Apple. But the counting ritual is also therapeutic -- a means for getting a handle on events that may still feel wildly out of control. 
 It wasn't until I saw the second jetliner smash into the second tower that it really dawned on me: Terrorists were intent on destroying our society and our economy, wrote Richard Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, in an essay for the National Association of Business Economics. 
 Would they succeed? he asked. 
 Not likely, but there's no doubt the attacks --which arrived in the midst of an already slowing economy --have had an impact on everything from the unemployment rate to what we eat and where we eat it. Following is a motley collection of readings taken from all levels of society since Sept. 11.
 JAYSON BLAIR

REBUILDING -- In New York, three weeks after Sept. 11, the city comptroller's office released a report estimating the local economic cost of the attack at $90 billion to $105 billion over the next three years. The numbers included, among other things, $42 billion for cleanup and security, $4 billion in lost rent and wages from jobs relocating out of the city and $82 million in lost parking violation fees because of street closures.

RECOVERING -- The United States Navy reports that the hospital ship Comfort, which spent three weeks following the attacks docked at a pier on the Hudson River, provided 17,000 meals; washed 4,400 pounds of laundry for New Yorkers, rescue workers and other guests; gave 13,058 massages; and issued 227 haircuts.

MISBEHAVIOR -- Crime in New York City in the month of October dropped 13 percent compared with the same time period last year, officials said. In the precinct around the World Trade Center, crime is down 23 percent.

GETTING INVOLVED -- Job applications at federal intelligence agencies are way up. The Central Intelligence Agency received 26,000 applications since the attack -- about seven times more than it did during the same period last year. The National Security Agency, another arm of the intelligence community, has received 19,000 resumes --about three times as many as during the same time period last year.

THE SHOW MUST GO ON -- Broadway theaters lost $3 million to $5 million the week after the attack, but have bounced back to about 90 percent of projections made earlier this year by the League of American Theaters.

THE SMALL SCREEN -- Movie ticket sales are down and video rentals are up --with comedies topping most lists. Some stores in Manhattan have reported that rentals have increased by as much as 40 percent since the attacks.

COUCH POTATOES -- Officials at The Wiz, a chain of electronics stores in the New York region, report that sales of televisions are off the charts.

BAILOUTS -- In 2000, one of the largest government bailouts was of the apple industry, which received a total of $136 million. Since Sept. 11, the government has approved a $15 billion airline industry bailout, and is considering billions more for Postal Service and insurance industry bailouts.

STOCKS -- The best and worst performing industries since the month before the attacks:

I.P.O.'s -- Initial public offerings of stock are considered a crucial indicator of the health of the financial markets. According to IPO.com, there were 28 initial public offerings of stock by companies in September 2000, compared with zero in September 2001. In October, the numbers improved slightly. There were 26 initial offerings in October 2000, compared with 7 in October 2001.

LAYOFFS -- The airline industry alone has laid off more than 100,000 people since Sept. 11 and economists estimate that in total, more than 360,000 people have lost their jobs thus far.

LEARNING CURVES -- Since the attacks, Penguin Classics has printed more paperback copies of its English translation of the Koran --about 20,000 --than it sold all of last year.

FOOD FALLOUT -- Many people, particularly in those areas most affected by the attacks, are staying home for diner. The Restaurant Trade Association of New York reports business is down about 40 percent in Manhattan since the attacks. Meanwhile, officials at the fast food chain White Castle report that sales of its Cave Case -- a take-home pack of 30 mini-hamburgers in a box --are 14 percent above their projections since the attack.

JUST DESSERTS -- Tentation, a French catering company with offices in New York, has produced 500 chocolate I Love New Yorkcookies.

OUT OF LUCK -- In the months before the attacks, gambling revenue in Atlantic City was down only 1 percent compared with last year. But after the attacks, casinos there suffered a 6 percent drop in revenue. They brought home $354.2 million in September, compared with $377.9 million during the same month last year.

AIRPORT CONFISCATIONS -- With tighter carry-on restrictions in place, security officials at Los Angeles International Airport have confiscated an average 5,000 offending items a day, including straight razors, ice picks, cigarette cutters and tweezers. That's more than double the levels for the same period last year.

BUYER'S MARKET -- In Battery Park City, the neighborhood just west of ground zero, apartments are now discounted up to 30 percent.

BARRIERS -- A Maryland company that makes 5,000-pound steel-reinforced concrete barriers, which are commonly used to protect public buildings, reports that sales have tripled.

MAKE MY DAY -- Gun sales in California, which has some of the most restrictive weapons laws in the country, have surged 30 percent in the wake of the attacks. The state attorney general's office reports that sales of handguns, rifles and shotguns combined have steadily averaged about 9,000 per week.

DEEP BREATHING -- Military Outdoor, a large supplier of military surplus items based in Greenville, Tex., reported sales of 39,000 gas masks to retail stores from Sept. 11 to the end of the month. The company reported just 250 sales in the same period last year.

MENTAL HEALTH MONEY -- Federal money given to the states affected by the attacks for mental health and substance abuse counseling: $28 million.

TAKING THE EDGE OFF, BOTH ILLEGALLY -- Marijuana seizures along the United States-Mexico border in Arizona were up 36 percent to more than 2,500 pounds from Sept. 11 to Oct. 1, law enforcement officials reported.

AND LEGALLY -- Prescriptions for Zoloft, Prozac and other antidepressant and antianxiety drugs have soared since the attacks, according to NDCHealth, a health care company. In Washington, prescriptions for antianxiety and antidepressant drugs were up 13 percent, while prescriptions for sleep aids were up 13 percent. In Manhattan, visits to mental health clinics were up 50 percent.

RUBBED THE RIGHT WAY -- At the five Spa Sydell locations in the Atlanta area, massages are up 8 percent.

 BODY:
 THE AGE OF SCIENCE
What Scientists Learned in the 20th Century.
By Gerard Piel.
Illustrated by Peter Bradford.
460 pp. New York:
A Cornelia and Michael Bessie Book/
Basic Books. $40.
 In May 1948 Gerard Piel, a former science editor for Life, started a new science magazine bearing the purchased title of a moribund periodical, Scientific American. Within a few years he and several associates created a model for science journalism that has had worldwide influence. By 1986 Scientific American had a circulation of over a million and was printed in English and nine other languages.
The distinguishing characteristics of Piel's science journalism were a conviction that science is both objective and a social good, a refusal to talk down to his audience and careful, even lavish illustrations and photographs. His ideal reader was a scientist seeking knowledge outside his or her own field. He often enlisted scientists as authors, coaxing them with meticulous editing to find ways of explaining their recent work to intelligent people with other backgrounds. A nonscientist (he was an undergraduate in history at Harvard), Piel educated himself in science at the same time he promoted and edited informative overviews of recent scientific developments, which the editors of journals serving the individual scientific disciplines did not do. 
Piel, who retired as the publisher of Scientific American 15 years ago, now presents us with a synthesis of scientific knowledge drawing on issues of the magazine during the last 53 years. He describes his new book as "what I have learned about what scientists learned in the 20th century." The main sections are "Light and Matter," "Space and Time," "The Living Cell," "Earth History and the Evolution of Life" and "Tools and Human Evolution." The resulting book is somewhat similar to a text for general science at the advanced high school or elementary college level, but infinitely more interesting. As Piel observes, such texts usually have an author named "Dull." Piel is anything but dull.
Impressive as this work is, however, it bears the stamp of the times in which Scientific American was born. Immediately after World War II, most educated American readers agreed wholeheartedly with Piel that science was truth and "offers the example of reason, tolerance and individual autonomy." He still subscribes to this view, and gives us an optimistic vision of the fate of the world if we can all only learn to think and act like natural scientists.
In his discussion of the future, Piel strongly emphasizes "the demographic transition," the coming stabilization of the world's population as a result of increasing education and development. He correctly notes that in most industrialized and highly educated societies, fertility has fallen to, or below, the replacement rate of two children per childbearing female lifetime, and he cheerfully predicts that all countries will be in the same situation before the end of this century. 
He endorses Jacob Bronowski's rebuke of foreign-policy makers for not letting "the tolerance or the empiricism of science enter the parochial rules by which we still try to prescribe the behavior of nations." Does he actually believe that natural scientists have better insights into the religious, ethnic and economic passions of the world than people who have spent their lives studying them?
In the years since Piel began writing about science in 1938, his readers have become much more sophisticated. At that time many Americans thought that science was an unproblematic positive force; the most difficult questions connected with it were the technical issues themselves. If we could just get the technical details straight, other problems would solve themselves.
Recent public opinion polls show that Americans are still usually enthusiasts for science, but they no longer believe that the most difficult problems concerning science are in the body of science itself; those problems are in the ways in which science interacts with society. In a time
of discussions of cloning, bioterrorism, global warming, stem cell research, nuclear energy, genetically modified crops and euthanasia, educated citizens have learned that knowledge of the basic science involved is only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition for intelligent decisions. Furthermore, Americans have learned that in such controversies scientists often disagree with one another. While they have not turned against science or scientists, they now recognize that scientists, like all other people, are involved in rivalries and disputes in which reason and tolerance are not as obvious as they were to Piel when he began his magazine. Citizens in the new millennium feel a need for a new kind of science journalism that will neither praise nor condemn science, but instead help them sort their way through these extremely difficult issues. Asking scientists to explain recent developments in their fields, as Piel did so well, is no longer adequate.
AT the moment this new need is not being well served. One logical source of help would be historians and philosophers of science, as well as the specialists in our universities in programs called "Science, Technology and Society." With few exceptions, however, these scholars are interested only in talking to one another, not in communicating with the larger public. The sociologists of science, in particular, have developed an arcane jargon about the "sociology of scientific knowledge" (S.S.K.) that only the most avid veteran of academic disputes is willing to follow. (I should admit that I am a member of the editorial board of one of the main journals in the field, and therefore shoulder some of the blame.) And science journalists, by and large, have not adequately appreciated the new need and do not usually have appropriate backgrounds in science, ethics and politics to pursue these issues in a way that helps citizens develop more informed opinions.
When Piel and his colleagues created Scientific American over a half-century ago, he correctly saw the need for a magazine that would transcend the specialist science journals and offer overviews for educated lay people of developments in the individual scientific disciplines. He succeeded brilliantly. Let us hope that another such talented journalist of the sciences will emerge in the near future who will respond to the need of the new century and give us similarly informed descriptions and analyses of how science and technology are interacting with the society around us.

HEADLINE: New & Noteworthy Paperbacks 

BYLINE:  By Scott Veale

 BODY:
 QUARREL & QUANDARY: Essays, by Cynthia Ozick. (Vintage International, $13.) In her latest collection of essays, which won a National Book Critics Circle Award, the author recalls her public school education in New York City in the 1930's and 40's and her formative encounters with New Criticism during its heyday in the 1950's. She also offers striking reflections on such topics as the Unabomber and the commodification of Anne Frank. Ozick is "the most accomplished and graceful literary stylist of our time," John Sutherland said here last year.

BETRAYAL OF TRUST: The Collapse of Global Public Health, by Laurie Garrett. (Hyperion, $16.95.) The author of "The Coming Plague" (1994) argues that the covenant between citizens and government in health care matters is broken; she outlines in chilling detail the threat of bioterrorism and the crumbling health systems in Russia, India, Africa and the United States. "These are lurid, disturbing and well-documented images that are not easily dismissed as alarmist," Fitzhugh Mullan wrote in these pages in 2000. "Her message . . . is a momentous one that is delivered persuasively."

ABYSSINIAN CHRONICLES, by Moses Isegawa. (Vintage International, $15.) This panoramic first novel about Uganda's turbulent postcolonial history uses the struggles of three generations of a single family to show how external forces -- religious, political and economic -- have blighted the nation and corrupted its traditions. Last year our reviewer, Richard Eder, said that even if the tale is disjointed and overwrought at times, "Isegawa makes his country a locus of life, tragedy and character that . . . stays with us."

A POSITIVELY FINAL APPEARANCE: A Journal, 1996-98, by Alec Guinness. (Penguin, $14.) Modest, refined and droll, Sir Alec Guinness, who died last year at the age of 86, holds forth on country living, the larger world, acting and the passage of time. "He is a repository of theatrical knowledge and a vessel of gratitude," Barbara Grizzuti Harrison wrote in the Book Review in 1999, "a man whose impeccable, fluid prose takes us from inner thought to outer action seamlessly, a man who in all his ways is buoyant, vivid and brave."

AFTERBURN, by Colin Harrison. (St. Martin's, $6.99.) Among the many balls tossed into the air in this thriller are an international tycoon (and former P.O.W. in Vietnam), his barren daughter, a mob boss and a young female mathematical genius jailed for hijacking trucks. It adds up to "an exciting ride," Stephen Dobyns said here last year. "Harrison writes extremely well, and sections of 'Afterburn' are as elegant as you'll hope to find in any novel."

EINSTEIN IN LOVE: A Scientific Romance, by Dennis Overbye. (Penguin, $15.) Plumbing the first 40 years of Albert Einstein's life, a science writer for The Times focuses on his subject's emotional, intimate side and how it affected his scientific discoveries. It turns out that while Einstein was a cad with women and a lousy father, he stayed faithful to his ideas about the universe. Last year in these pages, Jim Holt found "the scientific exposition in this book" to be "almost as racy as the biographical bits."

HOOKING UP, by Tom Wolfe. (Picador USA, $13.) The targets in this collection of essays include the death of the American novel, millennial self-absorption and -- in a vintage 1965 sendup -- the mummified New Yorker of William Shawn. Last year our reviewer, Maureen Dowd, found this a mixed bag, but allowed that "whenever some big bizarro thing happens . . . I want the man in the white suit to do his usual exhaustive reporting, turn the labels inside out and the hypocrites upside down" and "tell me what's what in one of those jittering, dazzling riffs of his."

THE REVISIONIST, by Helen Schulman. (Bloomsbury, $14.95.) A young neurologist, distracted and adrift, becomes obsessed with a Holocaust denier who changed his mind. He tracks down his doppelg* nger, believing he has found a kindred spirit whose example will inspire him to transform his own life. The result is "an original, bold and often moving" novel, Brian Morton said here in 1998.

ARTEMISIA, by Alexandra Lapierre. (Grove, $15.) Set in 17th-century Italy, this French novel tells of the twisting fortunes of two real-life artists -- Orazio Gentileschi and his daughter, Artemisia -- and the rapacious art collectors and wealthy patrons they dealt with. The tale "employs admirable artistry in depicting the turbulent life and times of two great painters," Peter Bricklebank wrote here in 2000. Scott Veale

LUDWIG, WILLIAM FRANK

 BODY:
 LUDWIG-William Frank. Died November 8, 2001 in Vero Beach, Florida from complications of lung cancer. Loving husband of Gaye, devoted father of Bill, Amelia, Jack and Julia, beloved grandfather of Stacey, Lydia, Anna and Zachary and brother of Judy and Donald. Friend and colleague to many as Vice President at JP Morgan and partner at Morgan Lewis G&A. Born February 2, 1930 in Sanford, Florida, Bill graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951, and Columbia Law School in 1958, after military service as an officer in the US Naval Reserve. Bill began a 26-year career at JP Morgan & Co. in 1958, first as legal counsel, then as Vice President serving the banking needs of many of America's largest companies. Bill interrupted his career at Morgan in the mid 1960s, heeding the call of John F. Kennedy for public service. He led the Latin American Lending Division of the US Agency for International Development. Bill was the first head of the workout department of Morgan in the 1970s and was named a director of Penn Central when that company emerged from bankruptcy. In the mid-1980s he created and led the bank's leveraged buyout activities. Bill's vigorous independence of mind, pragmatic approach to business and ability to find humor in almost any situation impressed all with whom he came in contact. From long standing business relationships grew many fast friendships. At the suggestion of a bank colleague, Bill met his second wife, Gaye McIntosh, just over 20 years ago. 
In 1986, Bill left JP Morgan to become partner in the leveraged buyout firm of Morgan Lewis G&A. After 7 years of creative and successful deal making, Bill and his family moved to Vero Beach, Florida to be close to his Florida roots. A memorial service was held Saturday, November 10th at his home in Vero Beach. Contributions in Bill's memory can be sent to the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Fund.

E-Commerce Degrees: Fight or Flight?

BYLINE:  By DANIELLE SVETCOV 

 BODY:
IN the final hours of the 20th century, universities jumped on the online money wagon, and for some, not without regrets. Many master's programs in e-commerce are now facing an enrollment free fall, yet another side effect of the failed dot.com economy.
 At the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, where 10 students enrolled in the e-commerce master's program this fall -- compared with 29 last year -- administrators have decided to suspend future admissions. Across town at DePaul University, which started its degree program this fall, no students enrolled. 
 Universities seem to be facing the situation with equanimity. "I'm a little disappointed it happened so soon, but I'm not surprised," says Martin Bariff, academic director of the year-old program at the Illinois Institute of Technology, whose problems may be compounded by its location in a competitive vortex of business schools. "My prediction was that we'd go four to six years," he says, acknowledging that enrollment relied on the dot.com boom. The program will last 18 more months, until current students matriculate. The institute will continue to offer an e-commerce certificate for students who wish to study the subject for a shorter period. 
Like Mr. Bariff, many administrators anticipated an economic bust and planned accordingly. "Our strategy was to start the degree program in fall 1999 with existing resources and monitor the demand for a couple of years," says Lorne Olfman, dean of the School of Information Science at Claremont Graduate University in California, which also reports a drop in enrollment. Similar strategies kept financial losses to a minimum at other institutions. But the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee committed $250,000 to its new program, including seven new courses; enrollment there has fallen 50 percent.
And then there are the concerns of students, who are spending one to two years taking courses in Web design, e-commerce marketing and law while juggernauts like Etoys and Webvan fall out of the race.
"Our current students are worried about two things," Mr. Bariff says. "One, can they get a job? And two, if their degree is not going to last a decade or more, what is the value of it?"
But a rosier forecast comes from the University of Wyoming, which spent nearly $500,000 on an e-commerce program and benefits from being in a region short on information-technology professionals. The program is full. Temple University in Philadelphia, ranked the 14th best technology-business school by ComputerWorld magazine, says it also has not seen a decline in interest in its two-year-old program. "As with any discipline, it will evolve and morph in various ways," says Raj Chandran, senior associate dean of Temple's business school, which spent $2 million on an e-commerce institute with some 20 new teachers. "We feel that there will be a continuing interest in e-commerce."
Forrester Research, which issues reports on the technology industry, supports Mr. Chandran's view. According to Forrester, consumers bought a not-insignificant $4 billion in online goods in August (about the same as last year).
Students -- paying from $15,000 to $40,000 in tuition -- have no choice but to look at the bright side. "In any technology-related industry you have to keep educating yourself on latest developments," says Adam Parikh, an e-commerce student at Wisconsin. He thinks e-commerce will prevail, especially as companies look for ways to cut costs. "E-commerce is the perfect way to automate processes and become more efficient," he says. "We have also been fortunate enough to learn from the mistakes and successes of others. We have been educated to avoid the pitfalls of e-commerce pioneers."
In most cases, these stand-alone degrees grew out of existing M.B.A. programs with the aim of graduating managers who understand both strategy and information systems. Compulsory courses have names like "Database Analysis and Design" and "Accounting Information Systems for E-Business." 
For his Web design course at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Jeff Correll has just completed a review of casino Web sites. And he's happy to announce: The casinos have not optimized their e-commerce potential. DANIELLE SVETCOV

 Organized labor and students come together.

1940-50
As interest in Communism and Socialism flourishes, the party forms many youth adjuncts on campuses. Labor unions also recruit heavily and openly, mobilizing labor-led student groups like the American Youth for Democracy, the American Student Union and the American Student Congress to fight, among other issues, low pay and racial discrimination in the workplace.

Antidiscrimination activists in the labor movement "discover" Jim Crow segregation policies that have been operating unchallenged in the South for decades. The civil rights movement is powered by professional activists and black church organizations. Eventually students, many from northern universities, become involved.

Feb. 1, 1960
Using the now-established tactic of the sit-in, four black North Carolina students are arrested when they refuse to leave a whites-only lunch counter at an F.W. Woolworth store in Greensboro, N.C.

May 1960
The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee is formed as a spinoff of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Congress of Racial Equality, two stalwarts in the civil rights movement. The youth group establishes headquarters in Atlanta and elects a chairman, Marion Barry, a Fisk University student and future mayor of Washington.

June 11-15, 1962
About 60 activists, including Tom Hayden, a student at the University of Michigan and future California state senator, hold a retreat at an autoworkers' union conference hall in Port Huron, Mich., near Detroit, a symbol of the American labor movement. The resulting Port Huron statement is declared the guiding manifesto of Students for a Democratic Society. The statement, calling for a new left, is sweeping in its concerns -- ending the Vietnam War, poverty, racial discrimination and the spread of atomic weapons.

1963
As Jim Crow policies fall away, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee turns to helping Southern blacks register and cast their votes. Bloody confrontations are often the result.

PUB-DATE: March 7, 1965
Protesters for civil rights, including members and leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, are beaten as they march from Montgomery to Selma, Ala., a city particularly hostile to voting rights. In the Ghandian tradition of passive resistance, marchers do not fight back. Photographs of the beatings outrage the American public and help pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965, providing federal protection for black voters.
May 1966
Young black activists become impatient with civil disobedience and what they see as a white takeover of their movement. New leaders emerge from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee calling for the use of violence in self-defense. Stokely Carmichael, a recent graduate of Howard University, is elected president of the group.

June 1966
At a news conference with Representative Adam Clayton Powell, Stokely Carmichael (above, seated) advocates black power, which alienates many of his group's moderate supporters. By early 1967, the committee is near bankruptcy and he has left to help found the Black Panther Party, a group that adopts the dress of the Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara and maintains caches of arms.

1968
Students for a Democratic Society has chapters in 44 cities, but ideological splits emerge among those who want to achieve change "by any means necessary" (the Black Panther slogan) and those who want to work within the system. One radical faction, largely students who have dropped out of school to "make revolution," name themselves the Weather Underground.

While racial discrimination continues as a student concern, the war and the draft become a larger focus as American involvement in Vietnam deepens.

PUB-DATE: April 30, 1968
Students take over five Columbia University buildings and sit in at the office of the president, Grayson L. Kirk, to protest the university's plan to build a gymnasium in a park abutting Harlem, and its affiliation with a consortium that does military research for the government. There are scuffles, and hundreds of students are arrested. Mr. Kirk (above, left) explains to the press his decision to call in the police. Widely criticized, he eventually resigns.

May 2-4, 1970
On the night of May 2, a violent demonstration erupts on the central campus of Kent State University in Ohio. The crowd sets fire to the Reserve Officer Training Center with Molotov cocktails and beats up a firefighter. The police in riot gear force students to disperse. On May 3, several thousand attend another antiwar rally that becomes a melee of surging protesters, rock throwing and tear gas. Members of a National Guard unit fire their rifles. Four students are killed and nine are wounded.

By the late 70's many S.D.S. and Weather Underground members have gone into hiding to avoid federal prosecution. With the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, student activists are without a pressing issue. Many would rather hit the books anyway. By the early 80's, with inflation and a stagnant economy, students are anxious about getting jobs after college. Activism is less chaotic and more polite.

April 1985
On April 4, Columbia students chain the doors of the administration building and demonstrate for four weeks to protest the university's investment in countries that do business with South Africa. On April 22, about 30 students at Cornell construct huts of cardboard, tin and garbage bags behind the administration building to represent South African shantytowns. Over five days about 1,000 are arrested at Cornell.

The late 90's and the present are marked, once again, by an alliance of students and organized labor. In an era when many students will go to work for huge conglomerates, activists take aim at the corporation. This dovetails with organized labor's distrust of globalization, which forces union workers to compete with low-paid workers in undeveloped countries.

PUB-DATE: June 1, 1996
To gain foot soldiers and reinvigorate itself, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. starts Union Summer, a four-week internship for students who want to learn organizing skills and work at the grass-roots level of the labor movement.

Summer 1998
Students from Union Summer start United Students Against Sweatshops to protest conditions at overseas factories that produce the logo-covered clothing sold on campus. The group sets up 100 chapters its first year, and dozens more such organizations emerge on campuses across the country. One target is the biggest manufacturer of athletic shoes, Nike. A number of universities adopt new policies.

December 1999
Student activists of varied stripes converge in Seattle, where the World Trade Organization is meeting to negotiate ending trade barriers among nations. The students are part of a demonstration of 30,000 to 50,000 people of all ages who find common cause protesting large corporations and the globalization of trade. Most marchers are peaceful, but small groups break windows and stone the police, who respond with tear gas and arrest nearly 600. The meeting ends with no new agreements and is considered a failure.

April 18-May 9, 2001
About 50 Harvard students refuse to leave an administration building until the university agrees to raise what it pays janitors to $10.25 an hour. After 20 days they roll up their sleeping bags and leave the hall, and the university agrees to form a commission to study the issue.

Public Radio's Private Guru

BYLINE:  By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN 

 BODY:
DURING the final days of October, as the public radio station WAMU-FM in Washington launched an on-air fund drive, one particular group of former listeners began calling in to donate only their complaints. They were fans of a bluegrass show that had been dropped without warning four months earlier from its coveted slot during drive-time on weekday afternoons. Refusing to contribute money, demanding refunds of previous gifts, the protesters meant to deny WAMU its goal of raising $1 million. And this was only their latest piece of political theater.
 In the preceding weeks, bluegrass loyalists had picketed two fund-raising events, one man carrying a sign declaring "WAMU = Fraud, Stupidity and Heartache." "Save Bluegrass" Web sites and e-mail lists had sprung up. Back before the terror attacks of Sept. 11 had consumed Congressional attention, Representative Howard Coble of North Carolina had taken to the floor of the House to declare, "Perhaps the WAMU management team needs to be introduced to the woodshed." 
 This sort of strife was not limited to Washington, either. Seven months earlier and 2,000 miles away, to the strains of Haydn's "Farewell" symphony, the public station KUER-FM in Salt Lake City ended 40 years of broadcasting classical music, bringing condemnation from the Utah legislature and the state's major newspapers. Meanwhile, in Maine, town meetings were being held to assail the state public radio system for dropping live broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera. (They were ultimately restored.) And in Roanoke, Va., the United States District Court prepared to hear the case of the NPR station WVTF's former manager. He was suing university and state officials for $2 million for having fired him shortly after he dropped the Met broadcasts, which were restored over his objections.
All these controversies, seemingly so disparate, traced back to a common source. His name is David Giovannoni. A brilliant analyst of public radio's audience -- who it is, how much it listens, when it listens, what it listens to, when and why it donates money -- he is quite possibly the most influential figure in shaping the sound of National Public Radio today, the sound heard by upward of 20 million Americans weekly.
Mr. Giovannoni's company in suburban Washington, Audience Research Analysis, holds contracts with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Public Radio, Public Radio International and almost every major NPR member station in the country. He essentially invented the language of public radio today, terms like "affinity," "loyalty," "power" and "public service." The phrase most public stations intone in their hourly ID's -- "listener-supported" -- grew out of Mr. Giovannoni's research. What might be considered the standard public-radio schedule, with its daylong emphasis on news and talk, largely subscribes to his findings. And during the years NPR has applied Mr. Giovannoni's findings, it has more than doubled listenership and gone from near bankruptcy to financial stability.
Every one of the radio stations involved in these recent battles acted largely on Mr. Giovannoni's research. His analysis showed them that, however vociferous the audience for bluegrass in Washington or symphonies in Salt Lake City or the Met in Virginia and Maine, those programs drove away a vast majority of the most loyal listeners and donors. The way to bring them and their checkbooks back was to schedule more of the news and information programs they craved.
As such, Mr. Giovannoni is the lightning rod for the intense, often bitter debate about what course NPR and its member stations should take in their evolution from a hodgepodge of "educational broadcasting" outlets dependent on the largess of universities and the federal government to a media powerhouse increasingly independent of the public sector. Depending on whom you ask, Mr. Giovannoni either helped save NPR by pointing the path to financial self-sufficiency or helped undermine the kind of programming that made it worth saving in the first place. "A visionary," says Richard Madden, the vice president of radio at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. "A numbers Nazi," the independent producer Larry Josephson labeled him several years ago.
For all the heated language, the conflict shaking public radio is not the stereotypical struggle between aesthetes and philistines. When Mr. Giovannoni's clients dropped country and classical music, or consigned them to weekends and the after-midnight abyss, they didn't plug in Rush Limbaugh or Howard Stern or easy listening; they put on the news and discussion programs that have earned NPR its accolades: "Fresh Air," "Talk of the Nation," "All Things Considered." NPR's superb coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks, starting with round-the-clock reporting the first week, may have served as the ultimate confirmation of Mr. Giovannoni's thesis that news-information forms the most integral, essential, irreplaceable element of public radio.
To Mr. Giovannoni's critics, however, the reliance on widely lauded programs typifies the problem. Ratings increasingly rule. Every NPR station is sounding more like every other NPR station, with the same "news stream" during the weekday, the same lineup of "Weekend Edition," "Car Talk" and the quiz show "Whad'ya Know?" on Saturday mornings. In both Washington and Salt Lake City, music devotees pointed out that nearby NPR stations already broadcast the same news and information shows that WAMU and KUER were adding. Even as NPR basks in the National Medal of the Arts it was awarded last year by President Clinton for its cultural programming, the very genres of jazz and classical music that the system was created in part to support are shrinking on the dial. Inventive new shows, Mr. Giovannoni's foes contend, will not survive statistical scrutiny long enough to build an audience. Jay Allison, an award-winning producer and station manager, likens the reliance on audience research to "a deal with the devil."
For his part, Mr. Giovannoni says he abhors sameness, formats, consultants, all the plagues of commercial radio. He insists he never tells any station what to do or not to do. He merely provides information of unimpeached accuracy to executives who used to act on intuition, personal taste and informal feedback from listeners. He merely asks the pregnant, provocative question. "I'm constantly saying the emperor has no clothes," he puts it. "I'm shining the light on reality."
Now 47, David Giovannoni has been disseminating his findings and propounding his views through essays, speeches and workshops for a quarter-century. While his research instruments have grown more sophisticated -- from a pocket calculator to interactive Web sites -- his essential message has remained consistent. Public radio cannot serve every interest. It does not exist for the benefit of its producers but for the benefit of its audience. Attention must be paid to what that audience wants. Which, he invariably adds, does not mean selling out.
"Let me be very clear on this point," Mr. Giovannoni said in a keynote address last July in Phoenix to a convention of public-radio marketing and development specialists. "I am not saying that program directors should make programming decisions based on how much money they're likely to raise. That would undermine the values at the very heart of our service, making it unworthy of support. I am saying, however, that program directors should make the difficult decisions that give the public the highest level of service. That means replacing lower-performance programming with higher-performance programming."
A workshop that Mr. Giovannoni conducted last May for WNYC in New York typified his approach, and the tensions it can create. WNYC had been deeply influenced by Mr. Giovannoni for several years as it transformed itself from a station almost entirely dependent on municipal funding to one supporting itself, buying its AM and FM licenses from the city for $20 million. Since 1995, the station had doubled its budget to $16 million and almost tripled its income from members and corporate underwriters to $12 million. Yet WNYC also prided itself on a being a "dual-format" station, equally emphasizing information and classical music, an approach that defied his principles.
At one point in the workshop, Mr. Giovannoni projected a chart showing the weekday listenership for WNYC-FM. The graph consisted of an undulating series of bars, one for each half-hour interval, peaking between 7 and 9 in the morning, dropping into a midday trough, rising again from 4 to 7 p.m. The high points, as everyone in the room knew, corresponded to "Morning Edition" and "All Things Considered," NPR's "tent poles," in public-radio parlance. As for the lulls, as everyone in the room knew, they were classical music shows.
Mr. Giovannoni indicated another chart, showing how much radio WNYC's audience tuned into, regardless of station. Those bars remained relatively stable between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. "These are your listeners," he said, tapping the wall. "And they're not listening to you."
Someone asked, "Does that make the programming from 9 to 4 bad?" Before Mr. Giovannoni could respond, another staff member offered, "People come to us for news and information." Then is it a mistake, a third wanted to know, for the same station to have two kinds of listeners?
"That makes it harder," Mr. Giovannoni said. "A radio station should be something for the same person all the time. You become less and you become better."
By Giovannoni standards, this was an elementary tutorial and a gentle one. Without dictating what WNYC should do, he was delineating the consequences of what WNYC had done. Within its mathematical neutrality, his data was advocating a certain model of public radio, one that made no apologies for tailoring programming to the audience's proven taste. Although the terror attack several months later would leave WNYC with more fundamental problems to solve -- its FM transmitter destroyed, its replacement signal unable to reach half the normal audience -- the broader issue of programming resonated throughout public radio.
"Your challenge," Mr. Giovannoni said as the session concluded, "is to mine the existing audience. You want to support programming, right? It's hard to do that when nobody's listening. Or when nobody values what you do. The way to get more audience? The way to serve your public better? Lose what's on the periphery. Focus on a single audience and serve that audience extremely, insanely well all the time."
The eldest child of farmers in California's Central Valley, David Giovannoni stood mesmerized as a toddler by the revolution of records on the family turntable. In his teens, he began trawling barn sales for junked phonographs and joined several friends in an "Obsolete Audio Oddities Club." Then, one day when he was 16 or 17, he dialed the radio to the far left end of the FM band and heard a man urgently incanting what sounded like his life story. The station, Mr. Giovannoni later learned, was KPFA in Berkeley, beacon of the iconoclastic Pacifica network, and the voice was Allen Ginsberg reading "Howl." A whole world had revealed itself.
High school valedictorian and student-body president, Mr. Giovannoni chose the University of the Pacific in nearby Stockton partly for its public radio station, KUOP. There he first heard "All Things Considered" and logged 1,500 hours in four years. Graduate study in communications took him to the University of Wisconsin and put him under the sway of Lawrence Lichty, a young professor intent on wrenching the statewide public-radio network out of its stodgy, pedantic style. "Brilliant and innovative," in Mr. Lichty's estimation, Mr. Giovannoni was harvesting raw Arbitron data on public-radio listenership and devising means of analyzing it. "Back then, anything we found out was new," Mr. Giovannoni recalled. "There was no context about the audience. You turned on the mike and sometimes the phone rang in the studio to ask for a request or to yell at you."
When NPR hired Mr. Lichty in the late 1970's to work on the development of "Morning Edition," he brought his protege to Washington. There, along with the audience researchers Tom Church and George Bailey -- once ridiculed by Garrison Keillor as "guys in suits with charts" -- they first stepped into the conflicts that would recur through Mr. Giovannoni's career. " 'We don't do what people want,' " Jack Mitchell, a former producer and board chairman of NPR, recalled reporters and editors saying. " 'It's killed by research.' "
What ultimately made Mr. Giovannoni a fixture in public radio, however, were events far outside his control. The efforts by Ronald Reagan in 1981 and Newt Gingrich in 1995 to "zero out" the Corporation for Public Broadcasting sent NPR and its member stations hunting for more secure financial support. Mr. Giovannoni's research held the clues to how to reach the listeners themselves. "It was a terrible thing but it was a good thing," Mr. Giovannoni said of the threatened cessations of federal aid. "Those two hits forced us to become self-sufficient. And the way we were able to do that was by shifting away from a subsidized economy and focusing on the listener."
OVER the last 16 years, Mr. Giovannoni and various collaborators have released a series of reports defining the public-radio audience in ever finer detail, augmenting computer models based on Arbitron data with follow-up interviews and focus groups. These studies started by disabusing NPR of its pride in its weekly listenership, known in the trade as its "cume." Ninety percent of those listeners -- dubbed the "Cheap 90" by Mr. Giovannoni -- never donated to stations. Sixty percent listened only sporadically. The remaining 40 percent, the "core" in the Giovannoni lexicon, accounted for almost 80 percent of the hours listeners spent tuned to public radio. Over time, Mr. Giovannoni has refined his picture of who they are (middle-aged, college-educated, interested in social issues), what they listen to most ("All Things Considered,""Morning Edition"), what other NPR shows hold their interest ("Car Talk," "Prairie Home Companion"), what generally causes them to turn the dial (radio theater, children's shows, music except on stations with all-music formats), and even what encourages them to donate money at the highest rate ("Marketplace," "Car Talk," "All Things Considered").
The divide between culture and information appeared prominently in a 1993 study establishing the affinity -- that is, the demographic similarity -- of the audience for "All Things Considered" with the listenership for NPR's 71 nationally syndicated shows. Of the 27 shows that performed worst -- that, by Mr. Giovannoni's research, actively alienated core listeners -- a vast majority featured jazz, classical music and opera. In a 1998 study, Mr. Giovannoni found that music programming brought stations far less income per broadcast hour than did news, talk or entertainment. Popular music appealed to listeners a generation younger than NPR's core audience; classical music and opera appealed to listeners a decade to a generation older.
Mr. Giovannoni's conclusion, indeed his belief system, came down to one mantra: "Programming causes audience." People didn't listen to public radio because they appreciated the concept of smart, commercial-free programming; they listened for the same reason people listened to classic rock or adult urban contemporary or Dr. Laura -- because they liked what happened to be on. Putting more of it on, then, meant more listeners and more donations and more freedom from the caprice of Washington. (There are anomalies, numerically small but demonstrably generous niche audiences like WAMU's bluegrass fans.)
Following Mr. Giovannoni's precepts, NPR built its weekly cume from 9 million in 1985 to the current 22 million. It now raises more than half of its $500 million budget from individual listeners or private-sector underwriters. The number of paid-up members doubled to 2 million between 1990 and 2000. Over the same period, federal support fell from 16 cents per dollar to less than 11.
That dramatic growth has only encouraged NPR to become more cautious, which has turned Mr. Giovannoni into a convenient target. "To some extent, NPR is a prisoner of its success," said Alan Stavitsky, a University of Oregon professor who has studied public-radio consultants. "This once obscure and quirky alternative programmer is now part of the media elite. There's less room for the kind of offbeat experimenting with the medium that characterized NPR's early days."
"There's nothing fundamentally wrong with research," said Torey Malatia, the president and general manager of WBEZ in Chicago, the station that originated "This American Life," the acclaimed documentary series featuring Ira Glass. "But what happened in the commercial marketplace began to happen in the public-radio marketplace. There was this unarticulated but passionately held belief that there was a perfect formula and that if we used that formula in our community, we could be as successful as other communities that used it.
"But after believing that myself for a long time, I'd argue that public radio is at its most successful when it doesn't follow formula. Data is just one tool for ascertaining what works. And it's a shame that public radio is scared away from what doesn't show well in the Arbitron book or hasn't proven itself somewhere else or isn't understandable on first hearing."
Mr. Giovannoni's style also has wounded and alienated. He and his frequent partner George Bailey often led workshops wearing doctor's whites and Groucho glasses. A report Mr. Giovannoni released in the late 1980's, which calibrated how much or little of their audiences various NPR shows shared, branded those with the least congruence, especially opera, with frowning-face logos.
"Though I've been pilloried for it," Mr. Giovannoni says, "I don't see what I do as cynical. My role is to help people in radio understand their listeners. Public radio isn't just you in the studio. Something happens on the other side of the mike. And if people aren't listening, there's no public service." He pauses. "The thing a lot of people in public radio don't get is that I'm on their side."
Keenly aware of criticism, Mr. Giovannoni has in the past several years increasingly emphasized the importance of "taking risks" and "budgeting for failure." His own tastes in music run from Bach to New Orleans jazz to the alternative rock of They Might Be Giants. His research shows that certain stations can hold a loyal audience with programming built around music, whether classical at WQED in Pittsburgh or jazz at WBGO in Newark. What NPR listeners seek, he maintains, is not a narrow format but a "sensibility," a pattern of "interests, values, and beliefs," which explains why the audience for "All Things Considered" also responds well to the quiz show "Whad'ya Know."
Still, when the rebukes come, they do not noticeably bother him. Such equanimity owes less to patience, perhaps, than to an unshakable belief that while his critics have sentimentality, he has the facts. "Everything I've done has caused carping," Mr. Giovannoni says. "It's the allegorical loss of innocence. That's what research is. Every time you pluck somebody out of the garden, they get bent out of shape."

HEADLINE: Second Home Market Reviving After Lull 

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
FOR two weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, the offices of real-estate firms specializing in second homes fell silent. Phones stopped ringing, inquiries came to a halt, prospective buyers stayed away. The desire to purchase a home for leisure use seemed somehow frivolous.
 "It was very quiet for a few weeks," said Carolyn Klemm, the co-owner of Klemm Real Estate in Washington, Conn. "People put their flags out and went into mourning. No one wanted to do anything. Now I think that is lifting." 
 Brokers up and down the Eastern vacation corridor agreed. Despite the financial downturn that might reasonably be expected to stifle second home sales -- they are, after all, not a necessity no matter what benefits they offer -- business has rebounded, they say. 
But, by and large, prices have leveled off, neither soaring at the rates achieved in the flush 1990's, nor sinking into the doldrums of the late '80's.
Sellers can expect their homes to move, brokers say, provided they are fairly priced. Buyers will find more inventory from which to choose than in recent years and more willingness on the part of owners to negotiate. In addition, buyers are being attracted by the steadily declining mortgage rates. 
"We have had no business fall through," said Dana Marcus, a partner of McCormick, Murtagh, Marcus & Smith, a law firm in Great Barrington, Mass., that handles numerous leisure home transactions in the Berkshires. "In fact, it is just the opposite. The activity we're experiencing at this time of year is a little busier than in Octobers and Novembers of years past."
But the economy aside, there is a sober new twist to the search, as increasing numbers of people recast the weekend house as a refuge from anxiety. 
As Robert Pearl, a Manhattan developer and broker, who has contracts out to sell two weekend houses and buy a third in Woodstock, N.Y., put it: "People are saying they want a home they can go to in case things get really bad in the city. They don't want to give up the city, but they need to know they have a safety blanket. There is a greater need to go to nurturing places where there are rivers, woods, water that is soothing and healing, where your heartbeat slows down after a few days."
In such an area in the northwest corner of Connecticut, Litchfield County, where Ms. Klemm has been selling real estate for 25 years, she said: "We are seeing people who have never considered a second home before. They say they need a safe haven and what they want is not suburban -- it is country."
Joan Lonergan, principal broker and owner of Coldwell Banker Village Green Realty, which has offices in Woodstock and Kingston, N.Y., said clients who may have been on the fence before were no longer hesitating. 
"It's been a wake-up call," she said. "When disaster happens, you realize life is short and precious and people are deciding to make their move and not wait till tomorrow. They are looking for a place to be safe and peaceful now." 
And they want that place, wherever it is, to be a magnet for families, to gather grandparents, grandchildren, siblings, in-laws.
"When people proceeded to try to make their lives normal again after Sept. 11, their focus turned to the family and the home and renewing old American values," said Thomas B. Anderson, executive vice president of the New York State and mid-Atlantic region for Sotheby's International Realty. "I have been inundated with calls from people saying they were looking for a country house with a yard where they can find a home-oriented, nurturing lifestyle. When people think about their families gathering for holidays, weekends and summertime, they are thinking less of traveling and more of being at home."
Diane Saatchi, president of Dayton-Halstead Real Estate, has detected the same pattern in the Hamptons. "People seem to want to get on with it in a way I haven't seen in this market," she said. "They used to be motivated by money, status and image. Now there is a sense that, 'If we don't buy the house now, we won't have a place where we can spend the summer with the kids.' People want to solidify their plans and not leave anything up in the air and they want to have something they can look forward to as a family." 
Requests for rentals have increased too, not only in the ski resort areas of Vermont and New Hampshire where demand would normally accelerate at this time of year, but in seashore communities as well. 
Ms. Saatchi said, "People whose leases would have ended in the middle or end of September, who were beginning to pack up, called after the 11th and said: 'We don't want to go back. We want to extend or get another house to rent or buy.' A number of people who ordinarily would come out to look for something for next summer are now looking for year-round houses." 
They may be in luck. Owners who failed to sell their properties and developers who built projects on spec are renting them so that tenants will carry the overhead. 
Compared with the cost of summer rentals, there are relative bargains to be had. "I tell owners to multiply what they would get on a summer rental by 1.2, so that a house that would be $40,000 for Memorial to Labor Day would be $48,000 for the entire year," Ms. Saatchi said, adding that carrying costs -- snow and leaf removal, opening and closing the swimming pool -- add to the tab. 
Besides the renewed desire to have a place to gather the clan around the hearth, the faltering financial markets are also adding to the attractions of the second home market. For the moment at least, there may be more pleasure to be derived from a cottage in the mountains than from stock certificates. 
As Mr. Pearl, who sold both of his houses in Woodstock within a week, one of them over the Internet, said: "People may have less money, but those who do have it have fewer places to put it. There is a surge of fear about where to put money. People are scared of the stock market, and interest rates are so low that they feel this is an alternative they can touch, feel and use." 
That may be helped by the fact that prices are no longer escalating the way they did the last few years. As Judi Desiderio, vice president of Cook Pony Farm, which has seven offices in the Hamptons and three on the North Fork of Long Island, put it: "Bidding wars are history."
In the Hamptons, she said, "Sept. 11 marked a turning point from a balanced market to a market favoring the buyer. And a lack of inventory for houses below $500,000 is the only thing holding prices firm."
Otherwise both volume and average prices are down for closings reported in the third quarter, she said, largely because of the drop in the number of sales over $2 million. Such closings would have been based on prices agreed to months earlier. 
THE picture is similarly mixed elsewhere -- up a little here, down a little there -- with no clear indications of what will happen in the future. 
"We have noticed that the market has slowed down since Sept. 11, but we are still making sales and finding that prices are holding to what they were before that date," said Norman T. Callaway, chairman of a firm bearing his name in Princeton and Sergeantsville, N.J., and New Hope, Pa. 
"Sales may be a bit more difficult to make, but buyers are still interested in coming to this area," he said, pointing out its proximity to both New York City and Philadelphia. "If houses were ambitiously priced, we notice some of those coming down." His area in southern New Jersey ranges from Princeton to the farming country around Sergeantsville to the historic villages of Lambertville, Stockton and Frenchtown. 
For $150,000 to $300,000, buyers could find a three- to four-bedroom home, perhaps an old farmhouse in the rural outskirts or an attached Victorian town house on a picturesque street in Lambertville, Stockton or Frenchtown. In the middle range, $325,000 to $800,000, they would be shown a colonial, Victorian or contemporary house with four bedrooms, a deck and a detached garage. At the upper end, $800,000 to $5 million would buy a four- to five-bedroom 19th century house with numerous architectural details, fireplaces, handcarved mantels, high ceilings and in some cases such amenities as swimming pools and tennis courts.
Across the Delaware River in Tinicum, Nockamixon and Upper Black Eddy in Bucks County, Pa., "We are starting to see more people from New York," said Laurence Elliott, manager of Weichert Realtors in Newtown. "Business is very steady right now. As far as sales go, we could use more inventory." 
Like other realtors, Mr. Elliott said he had noticed increased interest among buyers in staying home at their second home. "People want to see places with pools now," he said. "In the past a pool didn't add to value because no one wanted one. Now the presence of a pool is helping sell homes more quickly although it is not yet raising prices." 
"The effect of the economy," he continued, "is that if a house took a week to sell in the last three years, now it might take two weeks. But it is still selling. I keep waiting for prices to fall, but they are still pretty much on the high end of the curve." 
The high end, he said, sits somewhere in the $2 million range, but even at that price a property is likely to be located near less costly getaways. "Things are very eclectic here," he said. "I just listed a property for $2,995,000, and half a mile away you could buy something for $60,000."
For $60,000 to $70,000, buyers could expect to find a small two-bedroom chalet or cabin, described by Mr. Elliott as "very basic, a place to go and do hunting." 
As it is everywhere, waterfront land is at a premium. The price of a small chalet on Lake Nockamixon could hit $200,000, Mr. Elliott said.
In Vermont and New Hampshire, the first flakes of snow have begun to fall, harbingers of the ski season to come -- and of the demand for houses in areas like Stowe, Killington and Stratton, Vt., and Franconia, N.H. 
"It's still a seller's market here," said Terry Hill, a sales agent at Mountain Realty in Bondville, Vt., the village at the bottom of the Stratton ski area and a past president of the South Central Vermont Board of Realtors. "The buying season for the winter is normally July to November because people want to get in by Thanksgiving. But this year, August was a little slow and that continued after Sept. 11, giving us a late fall season. 
"Now we're seeing a lot of interest from people looking for purchase and tons of calls for rentals. I've been getting calls from people saying, 'I'm not going to my Aspen home for Christmas this year.'
"There are more buyers looking than there is inventory both on and off the mountain," she said. As bankable as a waterfront location is in summer communities, so is proximity to mountains in snow country. "Convenience to the slopes is still a priority, especially for young families," Ms. Hill said, noting that trailside properties run from $350,000 to $900,000. 
There are two new high speed six-passenger chairlifts opening this season in the Sun Bowl area of Stratton and a new complex of 80 condos called Solstice. "They're not sold out yet, but they're selling very well at $699,000 to $900,000. They have closed on 37 and have another 18 pending," she said. 
But it is not necessary to spend that much. For $225,000 to $300,000 it is possible to get a 2,300-square-foot contemporary houses with three bedrooms, a family room and two fireplaces. 
For another $200,000 or so, the choice would include condos with what Ms. Hill described as "a superb floor plan for entertaining," connected to a sports club. "Those houses in the middle range, $350,000 to $550,000 is what we really need now," she said. Such houses would be 3,000 to 4,000 square feet and sit on one to four acres. 
For those with deeper pockets, Ms. Hill has two listings now at $3.4 million and $3.5 million. "Both are more than 7,000 square feet with superb craftsmanship, five bedrooms, wine cellars, exercise rooms, state-of-the-art kitchens, family rooms with theaters," she said. "One has three ponds stocked with trout."
Stratton is about a four-hour drive from Manhattan. Stowe is another two hours north but is known for having more reliable snow. "We are getting both buyers and renters this year who would have gone to Aspen or the Alps," said Pall Spera, owner of a brokerage firm in Stowe that bears his name. "It is easier to get in your car and go to your ski house than get in a plane with the uncertainty about travel." 
But he said he was having difficulty accommodating all the people knocking at his door, especially those in the market for reasonably priced homes. 
"There is a paucity of listings at the lower end," he said. "The higher level has slowed down from last year, but prices are holding. I think attitudes change as you go higher in pricing. People who are going to spend $500,000 or less are not as ambivalent. People who are going to spend $1 million and up are shopping and not rushing."
AMONG his agency's more expensive listings is an 85-acre property that has two ponds, one of them the size of a lake; a 9,000-square-foot house with seven bedrooms, six and a half baths and a state-of-the-art kitchen; and a garage with room for eight cars that also includes an automatic car wash. 
"This is the Filene's basement of bargains -- at $1.8 million," he said. 
In Franconia, N.H., Jere Peabody, co-owner of Peabody & Smith Realty, a Sotheby's International affiliate, which does transactions in 12 towns in the White Mountains, said: "We have not seen any slowdown in our market. It's been very, very active and I hate to say it this way but we've probably seen an uptick because of what happened in New York. 
"People don't want to say they're apprehensive," he continued, "but if they were thinking about having a getaway before, this has reinforced the notion."
Mr. Peabody is currently showing everything from three-bedroom chalets for $120,000 to $170,000 "with local views but no majestic vistas" to an estate belonging to the singer Patti Page and her husband, Jerry Filiciotto, for $1.9 million. 
Called Hilltop Farm, it includes a 12-room colonial house, a caretaker's apartment suite, a six-room, 3,000-square-foot log cabana overlooking a swimming pond, a maple sugaring business and 250 acres of forest and pasture. 
Another luxurious residence on Mr. Peabody's roster is one in Lyman called Echo Ledge. "It has 140 acres and your own private valley," he said. 
The custom New England farmhouse is built almost entirely of material taken from the property itself and has a marble floor entrance hall, a large living room with massive stone fireplace, a library, formal dining room, chef's-caliber kitchen with granite countertops, a vaulted spa room, exercise room, master suite and three guest bedrooms. It is listed at $995,000. "Anywhere else it would be underpriced," Mr. Peabody said. 
In Woodstock, N.Y., Joan Lonergan estimated prices had risen about 15 percent in the last year. "It used to be easy to find something in the $150,000 to $250,000 category," she said as she conducted a tour of a dozen houses. "Now finding anything under $300,000 is difficult, and to find anything under $100,000 you would have to go to a different county."
In this bucolic area of Ulster County, land tends to be more prized than buildings. "Fifteen acres with a cabin would be $325,000, but for the same $325,000 you could get a charming artist's home on maybe two acres," Ms. Lonergan said. "We don't have developments and we don't allow our mountainsides to be cut up, so land is becoming more and more difficult to find." 
That said, she drove up Meads Mountain Road to a spectacular piece of property: a 15-acre parcel with a 4,600-square-foot post and beam contemporary house with sweeping views of the Hudson River and Ashokan Reservoir to the south, the Berkshire Mountains to the east and the Catskill Mountains to the west. The price: $1.2 million. A separate 27.8 acre parcel higher up the mountain, which includes a building site and which could accommmodate a helicopter pad, is available for an additional $750,000. 
An 1880 carriage house painted dusty mauve that once belonged to Bob Dylan's carpenter is typical of more modest dwellings in Woodstock. But it has one atypical accoutrement: a freestanding circular fireplace in the living room, which according to local lore came from the nearby Cafe Espresso, frequented by Mr. Dylan and Joan Baez in the early 1960's. To sit by that fireplace will cost a buyer $315,000. 
Jonny Bowden and his wife, Cassandra Creech, had no intentions of selling the house they transformed a year ago from a dank 1970's style structure to a graceful contemporary design based on the principles of feng shui. 
But on Sept. 11, Ms. Creech, who played Denise Maynard Dixon on the soap opera "As the World Turns," was in Los Angeles where she is about to relocate her career. 
Mr. Bowden, a nutritionist and health writer, was unable to reach her. "We had been planning to commute from here, but now we are not comfortable being apart," he said, describing the panic they each had experienced. 
So they put the house, which has four bedrooms, a striking bluestone and concrete fireplace, balusters carved to resemble ocean waves, a media room, a meditation room and several sitting rooms, on the market for $379,000. 
But the couple, who have already given up their rental apartment in Manhattan, are determined to return to Woodstock. "We got engaged here, everything began here, and someday we will settle here," Mr. Bowden said.

Those Who Did, Shopped Discount

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH KELLEHER 

 BODY:
OLD-LINE department stores suffered a sucker punch on Sept. 11. Shoppers stayed home in droves, and those who have made purchases since then have mainly bought household goods, not the fashionable clothes that department stores sell. Shoppers and investors alike have been turning toward discount stores and wholesale clubs.
 Many analysts think customers increasingly want the low prices, easy parking and broad assortment of goods that discounters provide. Wal-Mart Stores, its stock priced at a premium, continues to get strong recommendations for supplying all of that. Target stores are also favored. Only Kmart, despite a huge presence in the marketplace, has been left out. 
 Wal-Mart is the darling of the discount group in large part because it sells food and other necessities, which consumers are buying despite a slowing economy. Its stock is a "great place to park your money today," said Bruce Missett of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Based in Bentonville, Ark., Wal-Mart reported gains in stores open at least a year of 5 to 7 percent in recent months and managed small increases in earnings. 
Food makes up 19 percent of Wal-Mart's revenue over all and 31 percent of its Sam's Club division. Next year, the company will build 185 Supercenters -- grocery and discount store combinations.
But Wal-Mart's shares may be too high for new investors. The stock closed Friday at $55.10 and has a price-earnings ratio of 38, compared to 30 for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Shari Schwartsman Eberts, an analyst for J. P. Morgan Securities, recommends waiting for a dip. "The stock has been range-bound between the mid-40's and the mid-50's," she said. "I'd be more aggressive when it's below $50."
Some analysts have reservations. Margaret Gilliam, president of Gilliam & Company, an investment research firm, cautions that as Wal-Mart Supercenters make up a bigger part of the business, the company will look more like a supermarket chain, and investors "won't get the bang on the other side of the valley" when the recession ends. Furthermore, she said, the company's domestic growth will not be that great. 
BUT Ms. Eberts is counting on international expansion to increase earnings. Wal-Mart has shifted to a decentralized way of business overseas and plans to expand in Britain, China, Germany and South Korea.
Many analysts are also confident about Target, which is based in Minneapolis. The company is eking out earnings gains and has differentiated itself from Wal-Mart with upscale merchandise. 
The company's stock is valued more modestly. Based on estimates for next year's earnings, Mark Miller, of William Blair & Company, figures Target is trading at more than a 30 percent discount to Wal-Mart. There is less risk for investors, he said, and a better chance the valuation will climb. 
On the other hand, Wall Street has been negative about Kmart. "Kmart is just kind of lumbering along doing $37 billion in sales but incapable of getting a profit consistently on that sale," said Shelly Hale of Banc of America Securities.
It has not aggressively renovated stores, said Michael Niemira, an economist with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.
"Kmart is up against world-class retailers with lower pricing, better merchandise and a better store base," Mr. Miller said. Kmart's stock price has moved from just over $5 at the end of 2000 to $13.55 on Aug. 8 and back down. It closed Friday at $6.50. 
Wholesale clubs, selling to consumers who have done their homework, have experienced in increase in sales since Sept. 11. In addition to Sam's Clubs, which is part of Wal-Mart, BJ's Wholesale Club and the Costco Wholesale Corporation are benefiting from a surge in stockpiling by shoppers.
Michael Exstein of Credit Suisse First Boston said that Costco had made major investments in stores and warehouses and should begin to reap benefits. Costco recently had poor sales on the West Coast because of a downturn in some economic sectors there, including high technology and aeronautics. Robert Nelson, vice president for finance at Costco, acknowledged some slowing, especially in jewelry, electronics and apparel, but said that the company was building market share in the Midwest and South to gain geographic balance.
Costco will open 36 stores next year. Its per-share earnings of $1.29 for the year ended in August were 4.4 percent below the previous year. But the consensus on Wall Street is that earnings will increase to $1.48 a share for fiscal 2002.
Most department store stocks, meanwhile, are mired in low valuations. "The values are cheap, but they may stay cheap," said Daniel Barry of Merrill Lynch.
In September, sales at stores open a year were down by double-digits for the biggest players, including Federated Department Stores, which owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's; May Department Stores, which owns Lord & Taylor, Filene's, Robinson's-May and Famous-Barr; and Saks. In October, they were down 6 percent to 9 percent.
Department stores have been losing market share for years. They sell only discretionary items -- fashion that a customer may want but does not need. They are in enclosed malls, which are out of favor with time-pressed shoppers. And they mark up prices, while bargain-hunters know to wait for the sale. Some analysts think the size and balance sheets of May and Federated will help them weather a worsening storm. 
Carol Sanger, vice president for corporate affairs of Federated, said that while she anticipated sales declines in the fourth quarter, the company was cutting capital spending to maintain cash flow, "an important key to long-term growth." 
Much of the bad news is already priced into the stocks, Mr. Missett said. "A company like May Department Stores, with a 3 percent yield, better than a money market fund, is O.K. if you're willing to hold it."
But there is no hurry, several analysts said. "It will be a very tough environment for another 6 to 12 months," Mr. Barry said. 
Ms. Gilliam said she thought J. C. Penney would improve. "It made a lot of acquisitions and getting them to mix was tough," she said. Last year, Penney hired Allen Questrom, a former chief executive at both Federated and Barney's, to turn the company around. But Penney's stock has already had a strong run-up and reflects the value of Eckerd, the drugstore chain that the company is expected to spin off.
THE future looks more challenging for Saks, Dillard's and Nordstrom because they have lower sales volume and less cash flow, Mr. Exstein said. 
R. Brad Martin, chairman and chief executive of Saks, said the company's diversity -- a mix of 60 percent traditional department stores and 40 percent luxury stores -- was a source of strength. 
The company announced on Thursday that sales for its traditional department stores increased 0.2 percent over the same period last year. Sales at Saks Fifth Avenue's luxury stores, on the other hand, declined by 15.9 percent for the period.
"Our government is doing a wonderful job seeking ways to eradicate terrorism and make citizens feel secure again," Mr. Martin said. "When that happens, New York and San Francisco and Chicago will be robust environments for Saks Fifth Avenue." Meanwhile, he said, the stores geared toward middle America will contribute to the balance sheet.

Can Xbox Electrify Microsoft Suppliers?

BYLINE:  By DAN COLARUSSO 

 BODY:
AS Microsoft enters the video game market with the release of its Xbox console on Thursday, some investors are placing their bets on allied companies like Flextronics, which is manufacturing the Xbox console, and Nvidia, which provides the graphics chip for the unit. 
 To meet sales estimates of 1 million to 1.5 million game players before the end of the year, Microsoft is moving well beyond its normal marketing channels. The Xbox release includes cross-promotions with partners like Taco Bell and MTV. 
 But even if sales reach that goal, Xbox will not "move the needle a whole lot" in terms of revenues for a company as big as Microsoft, said Jeff Bernstein, a portfolio manager with ING Pilgrim funds in New York. Microsoft is selling the Xbox for less than it costs to maked in the hope of eventually profiting on software development and licensing, several analysts said. 
But Xbox has already moved the needle on shares of Nvidia, a chip maker with a market capitalization of $7 billion. Its stock price has risen 90 percent since the beginning of 2001. It closed on Friday at $53.20. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said earnings for the quarter ended Oct. 31 rose to $44.7 million, up from $28.1 million for the same period a year earlier.
The company said it shipped $57.4 million worth of Xbox chips in the quarter, which counted against a $200 million advance Microsoft gave the company for initial Xbox production.
"There's a nice ramp of revenues coming from the Xbox," Mr. Bernstein said.
Xbox revenues are expected to account for more than 10 percent of the company's revenues in 2002, a Nvidia spokesman, Derek Perez, said. 
Mr. Bernstein said he expected that Nvidia's earnings would push the stock price to $60 a share by mid-2002. That may not be high enough to justify an investment, he said, considering the riskiness of the video game market. 
"You would have to be an aggressive investor to buy it here," Mr. Bernstein said. 
Flextronics may be a more conservative choice. Despite layoffs of about 10,000 employees in late October, or 15 percent of its work force, and a quarterly loss of $330 million, the company has weathered the technology slump relatively well, many analysts said. Because Flextronics makes telecommunications equipment, hand-held computers and a number of other electronic and computer products for a range of major companies, it is not as dependent on Xbox.
"In looking at its business, the Xbox isn't a significant percentage of Flextronics' revenues," said Dominic Vignola, an analyst for the Merrill Lynch Global Technology fund. "But it has the opportunity for a deepening relationship with Microsoft." 
In the last month, Flextronics shares have risen 14 percent, but they are down 22 percent since Jan. 1. Mr. Vignola said Flextronics' business of manufacturing products for companies like Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Lucent Technologies and other major technology players should grow rapidly as those companies focus more of their resources on research and marketing.
Wall Street analysts are expecting Xbox to contribute roughly $150 million a quarter to the revenues of Flextronics. Mr. Bernstein's fund is projecting 18 percent revenue growth, which, he said, could push the stock close to $40 over the next six to nine months. It closed on Friday at $22.20.
BUT the estimates depend on the success of the Xbox. Ray Scanlon, a software industry analyst at Citigroup Asset Management, said that if Microsoft reaches its sales goal, the Xbox can contribute more than $2 billion of the firm's total estimated revenues of $27 billion in the 2002 fiscal year. That would still consign gaming to the second tier of Microsoft's product line in economic importance, behind the operating system and software divisions, Mr. Scanlon said. 
Microsoft is likely to keep investing heavily in Xbox for the next couple of years to compete with the two dominant players in the market, Sony and Nintendo, he said. But if Microsoft ever decides to abandon the venture, he said, Flextronics probably has the balance to bounce back from such a debacle better than Nvidia. 
"For Flex, within a quarter or two, it could make acquisitions that would make up for or exceed what it loses with Xbox," Mr. Bernstein said. "It's a conservative man's way to play the Xbox."

HEADLINE: The World; 
Running Terrorism as a New Economy Business

BYLINE:  By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AT the embassy bombings trial earlier this year, Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network looked nothing like the far-reaching and sophisticated terror organization that most Americans have feared and loathed since Sept. 11. Instead, Al Qaeda Inc. resembled a start-up company struggling to adapt to the ever-changing rules of the new economy.
 The organization was beset by the usual office politics, ruthless cost-cutting and even corruption by some of its members. It was also revealed that Mr. bin Laden, like the chief executive of any shaky firm, found it difficult to maintain morale and loyalty in the ranks. 
 One former Al Qaeda member, Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, a Sudanese man, testified that he complained bitterly about his $500 monthly salary, which was lower than other members', particularly certain Egyptians who seemed to enjoy preferential treatment.
But Mr. bin Laden reacted to the complaint as any chief executive might. He told Mr. Fadl the Egyptians were paid more because they had more skills than the Sudanese, like the ability to obtain forged passports. 
Terrorism can be viewed as a warped mirror image of the new economy. In that financial structure, corporate chieftains manage lean, trimmed-down firms, bringing in consultants and freelancers to perform specific jobs. The specialists work as a team to complete an assignment, then move on to other jobs, often for other companies. The prototypical new economy chief executive can be viewed as a direct descendant of the movie mogul, a man with the power to greenlight projects pitched to him, who has final veto power over content or timing, but often little to do with the project's actual creation. His most important contribution is the money.
So Mr. bin Laden is a terror mogul. His diabolical vision, a mix of Muslim fanatacism and anti-American hatred, inspires members of cells around the world to carry out attacks in Al Qaeda's name. The organizers have re-emerged in plot after plot. Always, Mr. bin Laden is off-stage; it is believed he leaves the selection of targets and timing to lieutenants. His most important contribution, investigators believe, is the money.
And like new economy C.E.O.'s, Mr. bin Laden is constantly searching for ways to cut costs. The Sept. 11 attacks cost an estimated $500,000, the most ever paid for an Al Qaeda terror attack. Mr. bin Laden has his own ways to manage costs; the 19 hijackers believed their reward for the suicide hijackings was a greeting in heaven from scores of black-eyed virgins. 
"To me, this is a perfect example of bin Laden agreeing to pay the operatives the opportunity costs for their time, which is exactly what a C.E.O. does," said Jessica E. Stern, a terrorism expert at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government who is writing a book about Al Qaeda to be published in September 2002. "And he is very tight with money."
Another former Al Qaeda accomplice, L'Houssaine Kherchtou, a Moroccan, testified that he became enraged with Mr. bin Laden after he was refused an emergency transfer of $500 to cover the cost of a Caesarean section for his wife. This angered Mr. Kherchtou so much that he quit.
The two men's disgruntlement about money led them to jump to a competitor. They have cooperated with the American authorities, contributing mightily to the understanding of how Al Qaeda works. And both testified against the four men convicted of conspiring to blow up the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
Larry C. Johnson, a former deputy director of the State Department's office of counterterrorism, compared Al Qaeda to Amway, for it relies on a loose-knit organization of workers to get the job done. "Bin Laden provides the vision," he said. "but basically the members have to go out there and pull their own weight."
There is no hard evidence that Mr. bin Laden chose any past suspected Al Qaeda targets, like the U.S.S. Cole attack in October 2000 or the World Trade Center bombing in 1993. However, Mr. Fadl testified that a photo of the American embassy in Kenya was shown to Mr. bin Laden in 1994 and he pointed at a wall nearby and said it would be a good place for a truck bomb.
At the embassy bombing trial, prosecutors introduced boxes of documents that showed the cell struggled to do its job despite a daily grind of faulty computer software and dead mobile phone batteries.
Wadih El-Hag, a defendant, complained in a letter, "The battery for the mobile phone is almost dead; it cannot be used for more than 15 minutes." 
Mr. Johnson and other terrorist experts pointed to such problems and blanched at the idea that Al Qaeda was as organized as even the shakiest start-up. "They are pretty good at developing networks and sleeper cells," Mr. Johnson said. "They are not Keystone Kops incompetents. But at the same time, they are not James Bond-smooth either. If they are James Bond-smooth, Mohamed Atta wouldn't park a plane on the runway at Miami International Airport and just walk away." 
Another terrorist expert, Jason Pate, disagreed with the image of Al Qaeda as a new economy firm. Mr. bin Laden resembles a C.E.O. only in his keen awareness of the limits to the group's financial resources, said Mr. Pate, a senior research associate at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, in Monterey, Calif. "There are any number of religious fanatics in the world, but it's different if you have several hundred million dollars," he said. "Bin Laden equates money with power, and he is reluctant to give either one up."
THE idea that Al Qaeda ran as a coolly efficient corporation was introduced by Mr. Fadl, the chief witness in the embassy bombings trial. He served for a decade as Mr. bin Laden's paymaster. On the stand, Mr. Fadl, who left the group in 1996, said Mr. bin Laden functioned as C.E.O., and directly beneath him was the Shura Council, a dozen top aides who, Mr. Fadl said, strategized about waging a holy war.
After that, Mr. Fadl explained, the network was divided into a number of committees: a military committee that oversaw training and arms purchases; a finance committee responsible for the organization's businesses. There were also media committees and even a travel department, similar to a corporate travel arm. But there was an important distinction. "They give you a passport," Mr. Fadl said.
Mr. Fadl was so disgruntled about his poor salary that he said he accepted $110,000 in kickbacks from an Al Qaeda international trading company that traded in sugar and palm oil. He had a showdown meeting with Mr. bin Laden, who was said to be furious. Mr. Fadl was convinced that he was going to be killed. 
Instead, Mr. bin Laden was calm, even serene, and asked only that Mr. Fadl pay back the money. "In that way," Mr. Pate said, "Mr. bin Laden acts like a chief budget officer."

HEADLINE: Somalia Winces as Its Chaos Attracts U.S. Attention 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
In many ways Somalia is like another collapsed country across the Arabian Sea, one that is under American bombardment. 
 Like Afghanistan, Somalia is Muslim; each country drove a superpower off its soil, and each faces overwhelming poverty and despair. 
 Both Muslim nations are also chaotic enough to allow plenty of places for terrorists or their backers to hide, a fact of which the United States is keenly aware. 
The weak Somalian government, just a year old and not recognized by most of the world, has vowed to root out terrorism and says it takes seriously American allegations that fundamentalists inside Somalia have aided Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. Still, Somalia is wincing at the American reprisals and is not persuaded that its struggling citizens are secretly planning attacks against the United States. 
Just this week the White House announced that it was freezing financial assets of the country's largest corporation, Al Barakaat, which ships money across borders, often from relatives abroad who send a form of life support to their kin here. The United States says the company, and others like it, have been financing terrorists. 
These complaints have quickly upset life for many ordinary Somalis. "Look how skinny I am," said Abdulahi Lawil, 35, who waited in the offices of another remittance company, Dahab Shill, for the $30 that his aunt sends every month from Norway. This month's installment never arrived, he said, because his aunt had heard rumors that anyone sending money might be detained.
"There certainly is a growing sense that Somalia is going to be a second tier in the U.S. campaign," said Ken Menkhaus, a Somalia expert at Davidson College in North Carolina who is advising the State Department. "At the same time, it is no Afghanistan." Washington has found connections between the two nations in the form of a shadowy group of Somali fundamentalists known as al Itihaad, which the United States has listed as a terrorist organization. 
In its drive for a strict Islamic state, the group has been a force in remote towns, where it seized power by force and prayer. But of late al Itihaad has taken its campaign underground. On the rundown streets of Mogadishi, not a soul professes to know a thing about al Itihaad.
The form of Islam that Somalia generally practices is less stringent than the Taliban version. It is true that when the country's transitional president, Abdiqassim Salad Hassan, gives a speech during prayer time, the event has to stop while he and audience point themselves toward Mecca to pray. Yet the president's legal adviser, Abdullahi Farah Qaarey, who picked up a smoking habit while living in Sweden, can puff on a cigarette in the back of the crowd -- an indulgence frowned on under Islam -- but snuff it out in time to join in at the end.
"Religion is something personal in Somalia," explained Mr. Qaarey. "We don't force people to obey. We are 100 percent Muslims but we're not fanatics." 
Some believers envision a stricter Islamic state. They are fed up with the lawlessness that ruled Mogadishu's streets for the 10 years since the dictator Muhammad Siad Barre was overthrown, and see Islam as the country's answer. That lawlessness impressed itself on American minds eight years ago, when 18 American soldiers died on the streets of Mogadishu. They were part of a mission of 28,000 troops sent in to distribute food and aid in the midst of a civil war. The Americans withdrew a year and a half later, and Somalia sunk back into warfare and neglect. 
Other Islamists include some of the founders of Mogadishu University, which teaches Arabic alongside economics, and Sharia law in the same classes as Western jurisprudence. The school, which was founded in 1997 and has just sent its first class of graduates into the capital's mean streets, says its goal is "revive the teachings of the Islamic civilization, spread its heritage and activate its role in nation-building."
Somalia's Muslims also include the private businessmen who set up religious courts in the capital in the mid-1990's, to dole out uncompromising punishments based on the Koran, such as chopping off the hands of thieves and stoning adulterers.
Mr. Abdiqassim, while denying knowledge of a link between fundamentalists inside Somalia and Mr. bin Laden, took time on a visit to the town of Wanlaweyn on Friday, to urge farmers to turn in anyone suspicious in their midst. "Don't try to hide anyone," he advised. "Whoever you don't know, tell your people."
The new government, created at a peace conference in the adjoining country of Djibouti last year, is too poor even to pay its members of Parliament and does not even control all of Mogadishu.
Vast swaths of countryside are still ruled by warlords and two vast regions to the north, Somaliland and Puntland, have broken away altogether. Just like in the old days, when no government existed at all, truckloads of men armed with automatic weapons are required as protection to shuttle safely around the city.
But there are tentative improvements. Some clans who have fought to the death are now represented in the new Parliament. And the government is eager to bring in other warlords who are still holding out.
Still, many doubt whether the government will succeed in unifying the country, especially since its senior positions are divvied up by clan, the root of Somalia's anarchy.
The new government says the desire for calm may trump the ideologies of clan and religion. In its initial months, the government has turned militia members into police officers and taken over most of the Sharia courts in the capital. It has also begun collecting taxes, promising services and safety in return.
At the livestock market on the outskirts of Mogadishu, there is the bustle that one would expect to see with the transfer of hundreds of camels and goats and sheep.
But what happens after each sale is extraordinary for Somalia. Traders close their deals -- a strong camel fetches $350 -- and then they proceed to a makeshift office, where newly appointed bureaucrats collect taxes. Heavily armed soldiers patrol the road leading to the market and monitor every transaction.
The tax, officials admit, is not even enough to pay the salaries of all the workers involved. But the government considers the exercise a way of slowly reclaiming the country.
Before, "you had to be careful about being robbed," said Ali Osbole, a butcher who willingly paid the tax on each of the 20 goats he bought. "We wouldn't mind paying even more if we got even more security."
A corn farmer, Hassan Mow, says it would be "a great opportunity if bin Laden came here," responding to the speculation that Mr. Bin Laden might slip into Somalia. "I know exactly what would happen," Mr. Mow said. "Whoever saw him would try to catch him -- to get that reward."

HEADLINE: COLLEGE AND MONEY; 
Buy Stuff, Pay for College

BYLINE:  By Edward Wyatt; Edward Wyatt is an education reporter for The Times. His column on the economics of higher education appears in each issue. E-mail: wyatt@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Start with the premise that any money saved for college is better than none. From that vantage point, several new programs that help families put away small amounts of money for college -- and potentially large ones -- make a lot of sense.
 There are, however, caveats galore, starting with the fact that none of the programs that funnel cash from retail rewards programs into a college savings plan -- most prominent among them UPromise, BabyMint and EdExpress -- are likely to provide what a parent needs to cover tuition, room and board, books, materials and everything else that is part of the enormous cost of a college education. 
 "The whole vision of this company was never to say that we will solve your whole college savings needs through corporate contributions," said Michael Bronner, the founder of UPromise. "The point was to put people in motion, to tell them, 'You can save,' and give them different ways to save." 
UPromise and its peers are similar in principle to rewards programs that offer a rebate check for purchases made at certain merchants or through a particular Internet site. Others route money to a selected cause -- an elementary or secondary school, in the case of Schoolpop.com or Box Tops for Education, sponsored by General Mills.
But programs geared to college savings promise a big advantage for parents looking for ways to cover that looming expense. They provide for the investment of the money saved in tax-advantaged plans administered by respectable financial management companies.
The savings programs are known as 529 accounts, named for the section of the tax code that applies to them. Like individual retirement accounts, 401(k)'s and similar savings plans, money invested in 529 accounts can be invested and grow without generating tax liabilities. When the money is withdrawn for college-related expenses, the proceeds are taxed at the college student's rate, which is likely to be much lower than that of the parents. 
Of the college programs available, UPromise is the easiest to understand, the most flexible and has links with the widest array of retailers and products. The program begins when a person signs up through the UPromise Web site (www.upromise.com). A valid e-mail address is required. 
Any spending on a designated credit card at a certain retailer will generate rebates, which are then applied to the college savings account. For example, if a person registers her American Express card and uses it to buy diapers, bottles or anything else at Babies "R" Us, a participating retailer, 2 percent of the purchase amount will be credited to the account.
The credits range from a penny per gallon of gasoline to more than 10 percent of the total bill at some restaurants, and include big-ticket items like the sale or purchase of a house through certain real estate brokers or $150 on the purchase of a General Motors car.
UPromise members can also leverage their purchases, for example, by signing up for a Citibank credit card or enrolling a current Citibank card in the program. If that card is used to make the same purchases at Babies "R" Us or another eligible retailer, the buyer gets the 2 percent contribution from the store as well as a 1 percent contribution from Citibank. 
Purchases with the Citibank credit card at retailers not affiliated with UPromise will still earn the buyer a 1 percent contribution. In addition, UPromise allows a member to sign up relatives and friends who can link their spending to the college account of a favored youngster.
The earned amounts are regularly credited to the savings account, but how quickly depends on when a retailer makes a payment to UPromise. Then, the UPromise member can open a 529 account to invest the proceeds. 
To manage the accounts, UPromise has signed up Fidelity Investments and Salomon Smith Barney, which give a customer several choices about how to invest the money -- specifically, how much risk to take.
The eventual savings and proceeds from investments can be small or significant. For the most diligent consumer, UPromise says that savings and investment earnings can accumulate to $14,000 to $20,000 in an account over 15 years. 
Recognizing that such an amount is large enough to draw immediate skepticism, the UPromise Web site also offers examples that illustrate the power of modest investments and the magic of compounding: A grandfather who spends $25 a month on long-distance calls with AT&T and who has $280 a month in credit card spending could generate $1,263 in 15 years -- not enough for Ivy League tuition, but roughly the cost of a student's books and materials for one year. 
Of course, the real magic of compounding is in the assumptions that underlie the illustration. In its examples, UPromise assumes that investments will grow at a rate of 8 percent annually -- perhaps an aggressive assumption given the recent performance of financial markets, which recently ended the best 15-year period in their history. Many investment professionals think returns are likely to be lower over the next 15 years.
Also, there are expenses, fees and purchase restrictions to overcome. Though Citibank recently waived the $29 annual fee for UPromise members, Fidelity and Salomon Smith Barney charge a $30 annual fee for administration beginning in the first or second year, respectively. In addition, annual contributions from some sources, like credit cards, are capped, and there are plenty of other rules a UPromise member has to follow to earn the rewards.
There are also pitfalls that might be ruled out by common sense but which nevertheless thwart the efforts of many Americans trying to save money. For one, a consumer using a credit card to make purchases and earn rewards should pay off the balance on time every month. A single late fee could eat up the benefit of $300 or so worth of spending, and paying interest charges of 15 percent or more to earn investment returns of 8 percent is a fool's route to bankruptcy.
Skeptics abound. In July, Consumer Reports concocted an example wherein a UPromise member could spend $42,000 but add only $300 to his savings account. The magazine warned that "unless you're already an avid consumer of the sponsors' products, signing up is not worth the bother." 
But that assessment fails to note that over 10 years, using UPromise's investment assumption, the $300 would more than double. The resulting $600 or so could probably pay for a semester's worth of textbooks, at least.
Other critics have pointed out that UPromise sponsors might not have the best prices: While a member might get a contribution of 2 cents a gallon for buying Exxon premium gasoline, she might save 3 cents a gallon if she went down the road to the Zippy Stop. That is true. But to make a difference, the 3 cents per gallon in savings would have to be contributed to the college savings account, rather than spent on a candy bar or a soda. 
While significant savings are likely to accumulate only if a member supplements corporate contributions with direct monthly investments, the ways in which a creative consumer is able to save are legion. Those savings are not dependent on discretionary spending, either, but can come from the purchase of regular household items like groceries, a category that UPromise just added in the Northeast and is planning to offer nationwide. 
And again, some money for college is always better than none.

HEADLINE: The Making of a Student Activist 

BYLINE:  By Abby Ellin; Abby Ellin writes a monthly column about young people for the Money & Business section of The Times

 BODY:
In many ways, Ryan Nuckel is a typical student activist: he doesn't take drugs, he rarely drinks, and he is fueled by a nagging anger over the fact that there are haves and have-nots, oppressors and the oppressed. He and his fellow insurgents would never consider themselves a counterculture: Hippies turned on and dropped out. He doesn't want to drop out. He just wants change.
 For Mr. Nuckel, activism was a slow evolution, simmering under the surface until he arrived two years ago at New York University. He grew up in Babylon, a mostly white middle-class Long Island town, listening to the music of Radiohead and Nirvana and reading the speeches of Martin Luther King Jr. and anything by Kurt Vonnegut when the assignment was the Federalist Papers. His father is a general contractor and his mother works in a print shop. Both are Republicans. 
 "I was a typical teenager," he says, "greedy, narcissistic, cynical and alienated. You grow up in that, and then you become that, and it's awful. I felt really alone. And then something happens, I don't know what it is, and you realize that it doesn't have to be that way." 
Now 20 and a junior at N.Y.U., Mr. Nuckel is studying history with an eye toward writing. He wears the standard student uniform: baggy jeans, black-and-white Adidases and a flannel shirt. He is tall and skinny with an angular face and chronically disheveled hair. He thinks about his words carefully -- he likes "love," "solidarity," "unity" and "justice," along with "beautiful" as in "Unity is beautiful" and "Solidarity is beautiful" -- and then lets them out in a torrent. 
Sitting in an East Village cafe over one of many cups of black coffee, he searches for the roots of his unrest. He remembers his paternal grandmother, who died five years ago at age 63. 
"She died with nothing, no money," he says evenly. "My grandfather died when my dad was 10 or 11, so she raised five kids by herself, working three jobs with welfare, doing whatever a woman with minimal qualifications and skills can do -- a secretary, a phone switch operator, working in restaurants."
"When I hear about them kicking welfare mothers off the dole, I think of my grandmother and my father. How can you be that inhumane? It's a small step from there to sweatshop workers who make 25 cents per $100 shoe, or the workers from the greengrocers who made $2 and $3 an hour."
Mr. Nuckel wants to know: "Why do bad things happen to good people? Why do people's lives have to be miserable?" 
MR. Nuckel is one of the leaders of Students for Social Equality (technically no one runs it -- a hierarchy would not be sufficiently democratic). The organization, founded in 1994 in response to the Republican initiative Contract With America, is one of 308 registered with New York University's Office of Student Activities. S.S.E. has 300 members and a broad agenda of progressive social concerns, with a mission statement calling for "alternatives to the politics of conformity, selfish individualism and complacency."
Members' political interests intersect at various points: the group is affiliated with the national organization United Students Against Sweatshops, and a student might also be involved in the Campus Greens, a youth adjunct of Ralph Nader's party, or the Womyn's Center, a feminist group. (Overlap is a fairly common occurrence; even the Cartoon Lovers club co-sponsored an evening with the Democratic Socialists of America. The two groups watched the 1983 film "Smurfs and the Magic Flute," discussed communism and ate a Smurf-shaped Carvel ice cream cake.)
With a guiding hand provided by unions in need of recruits to push their concerns, students across the nation are increasingly engaged in such organized resistance, especially to issues that can be interpreted on campus: better wages for workers, or unionizing teaching assistants. Students are directing their famous idealism and agitation at the gap between rich and poor and the global tentacles of American corporations, staging hunger strikes at Purdue or clothing-optional protests at the University of North Carolina (at an "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Sweatshop" party). The bumper sticker of the day might borrow from the environmental maxim "Think globally, act locally." And the campaigns have been effective: Consciousness has been raised and university policies changed. 
In 2001, the American bombing of Afghanistan shifted the agenda, though which political viewpoint will prevail on campuses -- antiwar or pro-administration -- is not immediately clear. 
But what has surely emerged in the last few years is an ardor not seen for several decades. 
"A lot of factors have contributed to the new activism," says Robert Butler, the director of N.Y.U. student activities. "One is the push for students to become involved in community service. There's probably a direct connection between seeing a problem and seeing constructive ways of getting involved in the problem. More issues have come up that students can really get a handle on, like sweatshops and the Graduate Student Union. The catalyst for that has been a much more savvy group of students in terms of their understanding of the issues, how to work within the system to try to affect change and how to work outside of the system to also put pressure on those who can make change." 
In the incubator that is a college campus, where members of a generation are geographically collected for the last time, peer pressure and shared current events motivate activism far more than political leanings, according to Ben Park, an assistant professor of human development and family studies at Penn State. He recently completed a study of student activism in South Korea and is now surveying American campuses. Students who are active in social organizations are more likely to get involved in protests because of what Dr. Park calls the "age-cohort effect," an idea that refutes the profile of insurgent as misfit. 
Like most college students, core members of Students for Social Equality -- the 30 or so who show up for weekly meetings -- travel in a pack. They grapple with the same existential dread. Although a serious lot, they go to parties, listen to loud music, admire David Lynch and Bob Dylan, and worry about their relationships. Mostly, though, they drink coffee, smoke cigarettes and organize. They are sure that they can influence the world around them, and that they are right.
"I was raised to think that way," says Katie Griffiths, a 20-year-old history major. Ms. Griffiths, the daughter of a doctor and a civil rights lawyer in Houston, first organized a protest while she was still in high school. After administrators adopted a dress code, she persuaded 700 of the school's 750 students to write letters, co-signed by their parents, asking that it be rescinded. It was. 
"That was my first real opportunity to see that I could have an effect on things," she says, clicking a metal bar pierced through her tongue. After spending her freshman year at Haverford College, she decided that the campus felt too small and quiet, and she transferred to N.Y.U. "I can't separate my politics from my life," she says. "The two are completely intertwined." 
Corey Eastwood, another S.S.E. member, became active in high school after reading the radical historian Howard Zinn and watching his father, who works for Con Edison, commute three hours a day to his job. "I was never able to spend much time with him because he was always working," says Mr. Eastwood, 20, a redhead with a silver ring piercing his nostrils like a tiny cowbell. "That got me interested in workers' rights."
Last year, Mr. Eastwood took a semester off to work on Ralph Nader's presidential campaign. Now he is on the steering committee of the national Campus Greens, of which there are more than 100 chapters.
Mr. Nuckel credits a former girlfriend, Sabrina Lee, with awakening the activist within him. She was a member of the Womyn's Center and S.S.E. The couple would talk and debate. 
"She had hope and I didn't, which is a common thing for people wanting to see change but not knowing how to get it," he says. "I'd always felt that your beliefs were one thing and your actions another."
Motivated by the peaceful protesters among the rioters in Seattle at a demonstration against the World Trade Organization, he realized there was a place for him in that world. In April 2000, he joined 42 other N.Y.U. students in Washington to condemn World Bank policies that they think allow corporations to run amok without accountability. 
For him, the scene in Washington was "amazing." He didn't do much except watch, but what he saw overwhelmed him. "I've never seen that many thousands of people except at a rock concert," he says. "It was amazing how many people were out acting on their beliefs and coming together. It was beautiful." 
He joined S.S.E. last fall because it was the progressive organization on campus with the highest profile, and was actively involved in labor issues: monitoring N.Y.U.'s dealings with apparel companies suspected of using sweatshops, helping with graduate students' unionizing efforts, and organizing Manhattan deli workers, 95 percent of whom are immigrants. 
"That was the best campaign we've done," he says. "They're immigrants, earning $2 or $3 an hour with no health benefits, working under abominable conditions. Most are from Puebla, Mexico, which is where one of the Nike factories we organized around is. It brought home what the point of the globalization stuff is, that the world is interconnected. The Nike factory workers have relatives who work at the delis here."
Most of the protests have been fairly peaceful, although members of Students for Social Equality were detained and cited for trespassing at the School of the Americas, a training center at Fort Benning in Columbus, Ga. Graduates include Gen. Manuel Noriega of Panama and others connected to human rights abuses in their countries. 
Last November, Mr. Nuckel and about 20 others from N.Y.U. rented two vans and drove to the base, plunked down crosses bearing the names of "murdered victims of terrorist regimes" and sang songs. "It was a really beautiful protest, really spiritual," he says. 
But the military police didn't think so, and fingerprinted them. If they step onto the base again, they will be arrested. 
"Yeah," he says, "I'd go to jail or fast or go through some discomfort for what I believe in, absolutely. I already do." 
Mr. Nuckel spends 12 to 15 hours a week as a paid intern in Brooklyn with the Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a reform group within the Teamsters, and attends nightly meetings for various causes. A B student, he takes two classes a day, four days a week. He is prone to headaches, and figures he sleeps about four hours a night. 
When school opened in September, S.S.E. was busy recruiting new members. Plans for the fall semester included heading back to the School of the Americas in November and unionizing security guards. But after the events of Sept. 11, their agenda took a radical new turn: protesting a war, before one even began.
It is 10 days after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. In the basement of 16 Waverly Place, New York University's undergraduate student center, students gather for the first meeting of a group tentatively called N.Y.U. Peace Coalition, one of dozens of similar organizations emerging on campuses across the country. 
Nearly 120 people, most of them undergraduates, show up: African-American students, Asian students, Arab students -- a United Nations of college kids. 
True to their democratic ideals, no one is in charge, although S.S.E. has called the meeting. Mr. Nuckel sets up the room, arranging chairs and welcoming people, many of whom have only recently returned to dorm rooms near the collapsed World Trade Center towers. 
"How you doing, man?" he says repeatedly, shaking newcomers' hands. 
While people straggle in, a young man tapes an oversized flip chart to a portable blackboard. On it is the agenda of the meeting: 5 minutes will be devoted to an introduction, 15 minutes to group discussion, 10 minutes to explain the process, 25 minutes to unity, 15 minutes to groups, and 5 minutes to announcements. 
Three student facilitators sit before the crowd. Everything will be done by consensus. The group will discuss every point and then vote. If one person dissents, the issue will be up for debate again. "We're all leaders, we are all empowered to lead this group," Mr. Eastwood begins. "Everyone's voice will be heard."
To start, the students are asked to share why they are here. Justice, peace, civil liberties and racism are some of the reasons tossed around.
"We all agree that something must be done, like a change in U.S. foreign policy, not bombing innocent people," says Mr. Eastwood.
There is a lot of raging against the machine.
"They're taking away liberty and defending it at the same time," says one student. 
"You can't be antiviolence in America and pro-violence in other countries!" says another. 
"Bush's view of justice is not the right view," says a third. "Bin Laden was trained by the C.I.A.!"
A Japanese woman raises her hand. "I'm afraid of a second Pearl Harbor," she says softly. "Entire cities were destroyed, 300,000 people were killed. I really appreciate your participation here." 
The room explodes with applause. 
Throughout the evening, Mr. Nuckel, wearing a black and yellow T-shirt bearing the words "Union Democracy for a Strong Labor Movement," nods his head and claps softly. He surveys the crowd and smiles. "It's a really beautiful room to be in right now," he says. "Everybody's brilliant. I love it. It gives me hope."
The group then tries to name the coalition and say what it stands for. Are they pro-peace or antiwar? What are the ramifications of "pro" and "anti"? Should they focus solely on the World Trade Center, or use broader language? 
Finally they decide: They are for peace and against war and racist scapegoating; in favor of defending civil liberties and for social and economic justice on a global scale, and for education. 
Everyone agrees on all but one point. 
"We don't have to worry about justice, we'll let God take care of it," one woman says. 
Pandemonium breaks out. God? Who brought God into the room? 
"I associate justice with punishment," the woman says. "We need to quantify what justice is."
"It's equity," says Ms. Griffiths.
"It's peace," another student says.
"Well, you can have peace without justice," another points out.
"It's an important question, justice instead of retaliation," Mr. Nuckel says. "But what does justice mean?"
They decide to focus on that question in future meetings, and students sign up for working groups. 
Before they disperse, a boy in the back of the room stands up. "Tonight is the beginning of Yom Kippur, and I just want to say that I can't think of a better way to atone for my sins and the sins my country is about to commit than this."
The group bursts into applause. Mr. Nuckel is elated.
At noon on Sept. 29, about 200 people gather at Bryant Park: 1960's throwbacks, socialists passing out literature, homeless people selling newspapers. There is a peace march on Washington, and those who couldn't go will march in Manhattan, from Bryant Park to Union Square. 
Mr. Nuckel is visibly annoyed at the low turnout, especially from N.Y.U., as well as the fragmented agenda. He rifles through his pocket and hands $2 to a homeless man selling The Street News for $1. 
"Everybody's got their leaflets and newspapers and not everyone's talking to each other and it shouldn't be," he says, folding the newspaper into his backpack. "The way it's been the last few weeks -- everyone's a community -- that's how it should be. Union Square after Sept. 11 was this magical place of unity. I was hoping it was going to stay like that forever."
He spots a friend, Yoon Soo Byun, a senior N.Y.U. journalism major, and enfolds him in a bear hug. "What do you think?" he asks. 
His friend glances around. "I thought there would be an avenue cleared for us."
Mr. Nuckel smirks. "Yeah, well, it ain't St. Patty's Day."
Then he finds some more friends, and soon the entire group heads down the Avenue of the Americas waving placards -- "War is not the answer!" -- and chanting "Bombs will not bring peace!" 
Police officers silently walk alongside the group, moving them along. "We're supposed to be digging downtown and they got us here for these people?" says one officer angrily, using expletives. "They're dividing the force for this?"
Sabrina Lee is exasperated by his words. "We're not doing this to take away from any effort!" she shouts. "We don't want more families to die. Retaliation can only make this worse."
Mr. Nuckel's face is ashen; he looks as if he is about to cry. "I'm afraid of things getting twisted around," he says. "We all want this" tragedy "never to happen again." He does not consider himself unpatriotic or even antipolice. "The whole country cried for the police and firemen, and they were heroes," he says. "The aftermath was filled with such compassion." 
Another march, this one organized by a citywide antiwar group, is planned for the following week. As it turns out, it is also the day President Bush sends the first round of missiles into Afghanistan. Thousands of people -- as many as 10,000 according to some estimates -- show up. At least 30 protesters from N.Y.U. gather in a knot.
"I can't believe they did this," Ms. Griffiths says. "The bombing of major cities is not what they said they were going to do. A lot of people died today for no reason. But the idea that people are concerned and want peace -- that made me hopeful. There was an antiwar movement before there was even a war. That's pretty novel."
She is asked what the government should do. "I'm only 20," she says. "It's not my job to figure it all out. I just know what's right and what's wrong."
Mr. Nuckel is subdued, his voice hoarse from chanting. "My dad called me up and said, 'We had to do something,' and I said, 'That's what the Taliban said with the World Trade Center.' You fight for a democracy by killing people?"
He shakes his head. This must be how the antiwar protesters of the 60's felt, like no one listened no matter how loud you shouted. He is dejected by the pro-administration demonstrations that are being staged on campuses to counteract the antiwar demonstrations, but he and his friends are energized by their mission.
The unity reminds him of one of his favorite authors, Jose Saramago, the Portuguese Nobel Prize winner. Mr. Nuckel has read his novel "Blindness" three times. "It would be a beautiful book to read now, actually," he says. "One day, everyone goes blind. They can't explain why, it just spreads like an epidemic. This small group of people who never knew each other just gets together. No matter how lost and confused everyone is, there's always love and solidarity."

HEADLINE: In the Tracks of Olympians 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN; TIMOTHY EGAN reports for The Times from Seattle.

 BODY:
THEY say it is healthy to keep some fantasies alive in a fertile corner of the brain -- a half-dozen or so active daydreams to prevent dry rot of the imagination. I'd like to hit a Roger Clemens fastball, do stand-up comedy for a night, swap tequila shots with Cameron Diaz, and ski the Olympic downhill. Not long ago, one of them came true. Not the Clemens, comedy or Cameron dreams. But for a brief time, I was an Olympian. 
 Anyone with a little nerve and a credit card can do what two friends and I did. We looked at the sites for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, which Utah will be host to Feb. 8 to 24 -- those for the downhill, the slalom, the ski jump, the moguls run, the luge, the bobsled -- and thought, why not? Actually, we thought: forget it, it would be crazy trying to get anywhere near the place. 
 But in the spirit of the American West, and to appease critics of taxpayer-financed sports improvements, Utah has opened its glide paths of glory to average people for most of this season. 
As fantasy Olympians, we mapped our course, set our schedule, made up our own national anthems. I was from a tiny country once ruled by the Marx Brothers, hoping to upset the Italians and the French. My two friends are extraordinary skiers, even though they live in New York. David is cautious, but he can turn it on in a flash when he needs to. Tim has a racer's mentality and fears nothing. I'm a hacker, self-taught, just coming off knee surgery. 
It may be hard to find an after-hours club or a Democrat in Utah, but finding a steep chute with fresh snow is easy. We arrived in Salt Lake in early March from two coasts -- my friends from New York, myself from Seattle -- and within an hour, we found ourselves at the base of the 2002 Olympic downhill. It had snowed two feet over the weekend at Snowbasin, 48 miles north of the Salt Lake airport and site of the Olympic downhill and super-G. For us, arriving just after the racers left, the new snow was perfect; it slowed the course just enough to curb speculation about the fine print of a life insurance policy. 
Snowbasin is a throwback to the days of backyard skiing. It still has an old-timey, small-town feel to it, situated in a bowl surrounded by national forests and hay farms in one of the few parts of the greater Salt Lake area not yet overrun by sprawl. Everybody seemed to know everybody else. 
The downhill may be the ultimate and purest of competitions outside of a running race. It is all about nerve and giving in to gravity. The downhill racer will fly over much of the course, as the rises give way to episodes of pure gliding. Older skiers, more grounded by cumulative effect of age and common sense, by definition are at a disadvantage. 
The 2002 Olympic downhill course, designed by the gold medalist Bernhard Russi of Switzerland, has a vertical drop of just under 3,000 feet on John Paul Peak. The top skiers will go up to 90 miles an hour. We took a high-speed chair most of the way up, then rode the Olympic tram to the top. A halo of fog that had covered the top for much of the day slipped away, revealing the entire course. 
Skiers do not register or reserve the slope in advance. The run is either open to the public or not, depending on whether racers are on the course. Calling ahead helps. And skiers are advised to wear helmets.
On the last part of the ride up, a member of the ski patrol warned us and other fantasy Olympians that we were about to try something dangerous, that people had been killed in the past by skiing off the marked course, and that only experts should try the run. Of course, he said all this just as the tram was about to unload at the top. There followed the usual nervous laughter and black humor. 
Then I edged my skis over the top of the run, looked out over the Wasatch range, the snow-covered valleys below, the expanses of white set against cobalt-blue skies, and held my breath. I could taste the adrenaline. I could imagine the throngs waiting at the finish gate, cameras trained on my cool outfit, the coach exhorting me to keep focus. When I pushed off, it felt as if I had dropped over a cliff. The run was extremely fast, and I was forced to make a half-dozen or so turns just to keep from getting out of control. My friends followed. 
Watching the downhill on television, it looks like a wild ride that's fun. The flat screen does not convey what it is like to be hurtling downhill at such speeds, the landscape a blur, skis rattling and chattering, heart pumping, all while trying not to become a whirling ball of flesh thrown into the netting that is put up along either side of the course. 
At the bottom of the first third of the downhill, it was clear that this fantasy would have to be done in parts. The entire 9,895-foot length of the downhill, taken in a near-tuck as the Olympians would do, required legs of steel. There are dogleg turns, jumps that come out of nowhere, and stretches of ice, as groomers make the run fast for the Olympians. 
So we settled for a number of controlled runs over the course of an afternoon, taking the downhill in parts, especially enjoying the last chute, when you go into a crouch and glide to the gate. I would advise any fantasy Olympian, no matter how good a skier, to do the same; it would pose a danger to yourself and others to take the downhill in one fast run. 
The second competition at Snowbasin for us was the super-G, which is basically a shorter version of the downhill, but with tighter turns, a bit steeper in parts, covering a little more than half the bigger course. David, with his style in the manner of the Olympian Stein Eriksen, skis never more than 12 inches apart, was born for that run; he left the two Tims in the powder. I had one good run, but while airborne, reveling in the speed, I let my mind drift for an instant and came down -- splat -- a head plant into the snow. 
Snowbasin will draw me back no matter how many fantasies I've depleted. I liked the view, the slopes, the relative lack of crowds, glitz and fuss, the low-key atmosphere. This may not last, as the resort has big plans for nearby development. 
We left Snowbasin after a long day for one of the central venues for the Games, at Park City, 33 miles from Salt Lake City and about an hour's drive from the downhill site. This onetime mining town, known for the Sundance Film Festival, feels more like a big ski city. There are backups at the traffic lights, turn-away crowds at the happening restaurants. 
Park City has three major resorts -- Deer Valley, Park City Mountain Resort and The Canyons. Only the first two will be host to Olympic events. We set out first for Deer Valley, site of the Olympic slalom, the mogul run and the aerials. My friends, showing their ski snobbery, thought Deer Valley was for retired corporate executives. Certainly, this resort has always pampered skiers. 
But once we started to explore Deer Valley's higher reaches, and its Olympic runs, my friends gave it tacit approval. We had no trouble finding the Olympic runs. The trouble, here and elsewhere, was finding times when the runs were open to the public. It was hit or miss.
On the day that we skied Deer Valley, the slalom -- on the Know You Don't run, (yes, they spell it that way) -- was closed because the United States women's team was training. We skied up to the edge of the run to watch the skiers push through the gates with great bursts, cut the snow with their scraping turns and finish with a dash. Fully inspired, we traversed over the moguls course, on the Champions run, which was open. 
The moguls and the slalom are on a run rated as single black diamond, which means advanced, and can be reached by either of the main chairs out of Snow Park Lodge, the starting point at Deer Valley. The runs were designed so the skiers can finish in front of a large crowd at the basin just outside the lodge. 
I hate moguls, those small ski bumps; some people ski right over the tops of them, others carve their turns around them. The Olympic moguls run, part of the freestyle skiing competition, is short -- a mere 700 feet -- but it requires full concentration. On our first run, I was cautious, while Tim banged and barreled through, whooping and hollering. Then his voice was suddenly snuffed out, and a silence fell over the slopes of Deer Valley. Face plant. 
We skied the moguls numerous times, learning something each time. We gave the run to Tim, on guts. 
The next day we went back to Deer Valley and found a brief morning opening on the slalom. I was told later that because of Olympic training schedules, the upper part is usually more accessible than the lower section. We started in the trees, where the starting gates will be, and dashed down the short course. The slalom is all about finesse; you cut your time by making tight turns and limiting how much you brake the skis on those turns. I loved it. And it's a shame we could not stay on it all day. After a few runs, we were shooed away to let the real racers have at it.
The problem, for competitive types, is that there is no clock to record your times accurately. But at least once a week Deer Valley runs a display clock on a separate race course, allowing skiers to post their times against the resort's resident Olympian, the legendary Stein Eriksen, who won a gold medal in 1952. 
On Day 3, we hit Park City Resort, which seemed less crowded than Deer Valley. In the backyard of the now-bustling former mining town, Park City will be host to the giant slalom and the snowboarding competition. To warm up, we decided to start the day at the toughest runs, the double-diamond-rated chutes and bowls that flow down from Jupiter Bowl. We took three chairlifts and then hiked the last couple hundred feet to the 10,026-foot summit, the highest peak in the developed resort.
But after skiing a couple of the bowls and some chutes through the trees, we all came to the same conclusion about the runs from Jupiter Bowl: stimulating, but perhaps subject to a bit of diamond inflation. A single black diamond would do.
IN Utah, that license plate motto of theirs -- Greatest Snow on Earth -- is no chamber of commerce claptrap. Measured for dryness, the snow at Park City averages 4 percent water content, about a third less than snow that falls in wetter climes, making it wonderfully light and fluffy
Park City Resort is huge, with 3,300 manicured acres spread over seven peaks, with nearly 100 runs. It took us most of the day to ski our way back to lifts near the Olympic sites. The giant slalom is reached by the Eagle Lift. The run starts at King Con Ridge and covers most of C.B.'s run, a black diamond. We had some trouble finding the run, but by the time we did, they had put up a gate closing it to the public. I came back late in the day, when other competitors had left, and skied twice. It was pleasant, not unusually fast, with great views and some nice turns. The run needed the extra snow that snowmaking machines were pouring on it, because the surrounding terrain was starting to go bare. 
The Olympic snowboarding half-pipe -- a course that looks like it sounds, a pipe cut lengthwise -- was up and running with world-class athletes. But that meant fantasy Olympians could not take their turns. It would have been interesting, since only one of us had ever dropped poles and joined the shredders 
What we truly wanted to do was play at Utah Olympic Park, where the jump, bobsled, skeleton and luge will take place. Driving into Park City, just after turning off Interstate 80, the park dominates the skyline on the mountainside to the right. The jump hangs over the valley, calling all Olympians to flight, or to crash like the jumper in the most famous video clip in winter sports, the agony-of-defeat segment from the "Wide World of Sports" introduction.
From December to March in non-Olympic winters, the Olympic Park jump is open to fantasy Olympians. 
Because of scheduling conflicts, my fellow Olympians didn't sign up in time and missed the jump. But I spent one afternoon learning to fly.
Our class of under 10 people began with a two-hour lesson by certified instructors. Then they started us out on a small jump, to determine ability levels. Those with reasonable skills and confidence were allowed to go on to the 10-meter jump, and beyond that, to the 20-meter.
Nervous, feeling stupid, my heart in my throat, I edged my skis out over the 10-meter jump. I did my countdown. I visualized my flight path. And then -- my cell phone rang. It was a friend calling to inform me that there had been an earthquake in my hometown. I had to go back immediately. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it. Others don't have to suffer as I did, since the jump now won't be available until next winter.
The luge and bobsled track, while open to the public when not being used for training or competition, is expensive and require reservations months in advance, resort officials say. 
We missed these two because we didn't have reservations, but vowed to return. Next time, we would go further, sliding along on the cross-country course near Heber City, and trying to get close enough to the ice in Ogden to find out if curling is a real sport or just some nutty Canadian thing. 
And when the XIX Olympic Winter Games begin in earnest in February, I will have my kids gather round the television set as I mutter, "Been there, done that."

Disney World Trims Some Hours and Shows

 BODY:
It may be home to the Magic Kingdom, but Walt Disney World in Orlando isn't immune from the rest of the world's troubles. Because of the slump in tourism following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it has reduced operating hours of some attractions and made other cutbacks. 
 Some live stage shows are being cut on certain days and Epcot's World Showcase section will open an hour later, at noon. Most of the Future World section of Epcot will be open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., instead of 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., but a few attractions there will remain open until 9 p.m. The Galley restaurant at the Yacht and Beach Club resort has closed; three other restaurants there remain open. 
 Disney has asked several thousand employees at Walt Disney World parks, hotels and administrative offices to switch voluntarily to a four-day workweek, resulting in a 20 percent cut in wages. Even before Sept. 11, Disney World had laid off some employees because of a general economic downturn.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 11-11-01: Prescription; 
In Defense of Folly

BYLINE:  By John Leland; John Leland is a Style reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
On the 43rd day after the attacks on the World Trade Center, the Garren New York hair salon, on the third floor of Henri Bendel, was operating at about Defcon 2. The weapons of choice, plied in the glow of flattering lighting and blond-wood walls, were afternoon tea, dish and beauty. 
 Jane Lahr, seated for her first cut since Sept. 11, held forth about goddess power, her own contribution to the campaign against Osama bin Laden. "The cultures that did this to us don't care about the female principle," she said, as a stylist named Brian Devine sculptured a cascade of Rita Hayworth waves. "If I had my druthers, we'd be dropping estrogen on Afghanistan, not bombs." A few chairs down, Skyler Madison, a life coach and hypnotherapist, finished a $250 regimen that included hair, eyebrows, nails and lots of talk about the war; she would have to go elsewhere for her Botox and collagen treatments. As her part of the war effort, she asked for bangs like Paula Zahn's. "All of this is very high maintenance," she said. Though she cut back after Sept. 11, she said: "Certain things you just can't stop. Like nothing would keep me from my hair coloring." And so it went. 
 After the events of the last two months, you couldn't help feeling the chatter was frivolous and superficial, so three months ago. In other words: exactly what we need right now, and by the truckload. If New York is going to rebuild again -- and rebuild as New York -- it is going to have to put frivolity on the agenda, without apologies. While the nation finds strength in the flag, New York is going to have to raise again the local colors: vanity, libido, ambition, attitude. We need our peculiar vices and vanities now as much as our higher resolves. As the great critic Lester Bangs once wrote, in an essay celebrating the naughty wonder of downtown New York, everything else is Gila Bend, Ariz., baby. 
With that in mind, here are some modest proposals for restoring the city in its proper profile -- not just the granite skyline of Robert Moses and Stanford White, but the fleshier, equally vertiginous New York of Dawn Powell, Barney Greengrass and Grandmaster Flash. Some are civic, some personal. Confusing times, let it be said, call for confused solutions. Forthwith:

Unleash the irony. After the tragedy, well-meaning New Yorkers rushed to declare the end of irony. Ben Stiller canceled his guest appearance on "Saturday Night Live"; two New York papers temporarily suspended the satirical comic strip "The Boondocks." What nonsense. Irony is the scratchy grain in the New York voice, especially in the face of atrocity. The most hilarious, horrific theater, dance, music and fashion of the last two decades have come from New York's gay men and black youths, born amid the wreckage of AIDS and urban violence. So far, the sorrows of the recent attacks have produced only tepid humor, even on the Internet. (Q: What's the five-day forecast for Afghanistan? A: Two days.) In the city of Chris Rock, Joseph Heller and Lenny Bruce, this will not do. Taste should be no object. If the attacks on the World Trade Center made reflexive cynicism feel callow, the remedy is not less irony, but harder, sharper, more dreadful irony.

Get out of the house. The biggest health threat to most New Yorkers isn't Osama bin Laden but isolation and stress. Which makes frivolity a public health issue. To shop is to get out and about; gossip and social climbing require contact with others. Besides their talismanic value, these primitive local rituals are far healthier than sitting home alone, gorging on paranoia and H* agen-Dazs.

Make love and war. Immediately after the attacks, the watchword in the Times Square offices of MTV was "more duty, less booty." This might work as a broadcast plan, but as an urban survival strategy, it is a recipe for loneliness (cf. paranoia and H* agen-Dazs, above). A more salutary prescription, for singles at least, is the apocalyptic hookup. On an evening crawl through the Lower East Side recently, I asked Jamieson Webster, a grad student in clinical psychology who had counseled people at ground zero, about the therapeutic value of the end-of-the-world love connection. She smiled; after Sept. 11, she jumped into romance with a fellow rescue worker. "I don't question it anymore," she said. "Human connections are important."

Get up on the dance floor. As long as we're losing sleep, why not stay out late? The Depression saw the heyday of the Stork Club and cafe society; the recession of the 1970's spawned Studio 54 and its churlish opposite, CBGB. David Hershkovits, editor in chief of the downtown magazine Paper, sees a chance for a similar bloom in the streets of downtown. "The city feels dangerous now, and that's kind of good for night life," he says. "It had gotten to be like a mall, safe for anyone." The dirty little secret of New York right now is that, for all the recent horrors, it has never been more pleasant. Without the rivers of tourists and lingering commuters, you can actually enjoy the charms of your neighborhood. Clubs, especially smaller ones, can be clubby again.
Before Sept. 11, as part of its quality-of-life measures, the city used the cabaret laws as a cudgel against late-night recreations; it was common to see lounge clubs ask patrons to stop dancing, for fear of violating the regulations. Now, as real estate begins its inevitable tumble and neighborhoods cry for foot traffic, it is time to start the recovery on the dance floor. And while we're at it, let's teach the firefighters stage moves. They're already hunky, inspiring and licensed to drive really big vehicles. If they are going to appear onstage at every single rock concert, let's give them the skills they need to really throw down. 

Flip the status food chain. With fortunes heading south, conspicuous wealth and expensive logos won't cut it anymore. I suggest a new Darwinian standard: bailout chic. In the new economy, the true test of a player won't be how much he or she has, but how much he has lost or written off. We've had vogues for old money, new money and dot-com money. Why not gone money? It might even encourage a little human respect for the working people who have been there all along. Besides, the social climbing is so much easier when you're going in the direction of gravity. Poor -- it's the new rich.

Trade in the tired celebrities. Walter Winchell perfected the city's snarky ambivalence toward celebrity -- part adulation, part subtle mocking -- as a psychological bulwark against the Depression, and the boldfaced names have been with us ever since, fueling the city's mutually nourishing cycle of celebration and ridicule. But surely we can do better than P. Diddy and Paris Hilton. After Sept. 11, at least one barroom crowd broke into applause when someone they mistook for a rescue worker stopped in. This is a start. As restaurants and clubs suffer empty corners, why not extend the velvet-rope treatment, ordinarily lavished on boorish actors and obscure socialites, to heroes from the neighborhood? On a tight block, these players can incite enough robust gossip and buzz to get the neighbors talking and stir business.

Return graffiti to the subways. The memorial at Union Square, where families posted fliers of the missing, was a reminder that the city's most cathartic, relevant art often comes from the streets and parks, not the academies. New York should honor that tradition: with a permanent home for the fliers and a rolling platform for the wizards of Krylon.

Stockpile the bile. How nice that the rest of the country has come to embrace New York, rallying around the courage of our firefighters and the grit of our mayor. But this cuddle is reductive; it shrinks the city's unruly sprawl to the tastes of outsiders. In full huff, New York is the city others love to hate. But as any true player knows, this hate can be nourishing. People hate New York, says Ric Burns, director of the PBS series "New York: A Documentary Film," not because it's unlike the rest of the country but because it is too purely alike. The forces that invisibly shape the nation as a whole -- carnivorous capitalism and sprawling diversity -- are in naked, glorious conflict here. "New York is a mongrel, motley, rapacious city of people trying to get up higher," Burns says. "New Yorkers embrace those values with a terrible honesty. Whereas people outside have a prudish reaction to the values that shape them." If the city starts to stoop down just to receive the nation's approving head pat, the terrorists will have won. (Though if any federal aid agencies are reading: we really, truly are the city of the rescue workers and gritty survivors. Honest.)
To the ground troops at the Garren New York hair salon, these recommendations hardly bear mentioning. For these women (and the few men among them) are pioneers of a sort who should be seen not as holdovers from an old wave of urbanity but as early homesteaders on the next. And they are as engaged by the crisis as any other group; deep down, even the most stylish New Yorkers are only superficial on the surface. As a stylist snipped and fluffed, Jeff Jones, the associate publisher of Gear magazine, spun a story out of "Sex and the City": on the morning of Sept. 11, a married man went to his girlfriend's apartment instead of his office at the World Trade Center. When his wife saw the attack on the news, she called his cellphone, expecting the worst, and was surprised to find him so nonchalant. No, it was just another uneventful day at the office, the man told his wife. Jones patted his five-button Dolce & Gabbana suit and chuckled at the predicament. Man, was that guy busted. "The way I heard it," he said, "it's a true story." 
Against a campaign whose aims are terror and disruption, there is something to be said for defiant attention to the superficial, especially when others are rushing headlong for the depths. This is an act of resistance as well. As Jane Lahr said, finishing her cut: "Mars only lays down his sword for Aphrodite. And this" -- she splayed her fingers through her tresses -- is Aphrodite." The battle has come to the urbane turf of New York and will be fought at least in part with the local arsenal, stockpiled through the generations. In the war against terrorism, they also serve who stand and sass, dish or have really good hair.

HEADLINE: RETHINK : Manifestoes For the Next New York; 
Traffic : Price the Drivers out of Manhattan

BYLINE:  By John Tierney; John Tierney writes "The Big City" column for The Times.

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani was never accused of being a transportation visionary before Sept. 11. But when he banned single-occupant cars from entering Lower Manhattan a couple of weeks later, he not only averted a colossal traffic jam. He also showed what New York could become if we take back our streets from the invaders.
 We should never have given away so much precious real estate to so many machines that do so little. Cars spend most of their time idling in traffic jams or sitting immobile at curbs. With a few reforms, we could have sidewalks and streets that are safer from terrorists and more inviting for everyone, including drivers. The city could be a transportation nirvana compared with the clogged highways in suburbia. 
 The goal is not to banish cars, which can be wonderful conveyances. Some of the drivers now excluded from Lower Manhattan quite rightly complain that their cars are indispensable. They should be given a chance to re-enter Manhattan -- but at a price. Every car in Midtown and downtown should be charged for the privilege. The driver wouldn't have to go through a toll booth or even slow down, because there are advanced versions of the E-ZPass transponder that can be read at highway speeds. Drivers on expressways in other cities are already paying tolls as they zip along at 90 miles per hour (and even drivers without the transponders can be billed because there are cameras that record their license plates). 
With a similar system here -- call it E-ZNY -- cars could be metered for every block they travel. Security officials could monitor the movements of suspected terrorists, and transportation planners could adopt their favorite tactic for eliminating traffic jams: "value pricing." When tolls are set higher at the busier places and times -- the F.D.R. Drive at rush hour, Midtown cross streets at lunchtime, Fifth Avenue in December -- drivers respond by carpooling, rearranging their schedules or switching to mass transit. Everybody wins, at least according to economists, because the time saved by drivers no longer stuck in traffic jams is worth far more than the tolls they're paying. 
Politicians, though, hate to charge voters for anything they're now getting free, and any attempt to impose tolls would be denounced as unfair to the poor. But E-ZNY could be sold to city voters as a way to collect money from affluent suburbanites who no longer pay a commuter tax. Politicians could promise to refund all the toll revenues to the public through a reduction in the city's portion of the sales tax (currently 4 of the 8.25 cents per dollar goes to the city). Reducing that regressive tax would be a boon to the poor as well as to the local economy. Charles Komanoff, a transportation consultant and leader of a pedestrian group called Right of Way, estimates that an average toll of 50 cents per mile in middle and Lower Manhattan, combined with new tolls on the East River crossings, could yield a billion dollars per year, enough to cut the sales tax by 2 cents in the city. That would give shoppers a new incentive to come into town, and they'd find miraculously unclogged streets when they got here.
"Imagine getting into a cab at any time and knowing that you could get across town in 12 minutes," says Samuel I. Schwartz, who coined the term "gridlock" when he was chief engineer for the city Department of Transportation. "You could do that with a value-pricing system in Midtown. Just reducing the number of cars by 10 percent would make a dramatic difference in congestion." Besides speeding traffic, Schwartz wants to use the reconstruction of downtown to reclaim turf for people.
"A large chunk of Lower Manhattan could be relatively auto free," says Schwartz, now a private consultant. "You could have interesting new streetscapes with wider sidewalks, more trees and plantings, more street furniture. You could connect Battery Park City to the rest of downtown with a long plaza built above West Street. You could have dedicated lanes for electric-powered jitneys. There could still be places to drive if you were willing to pay, and places for trucks to unload at night, but we should recognize that those old streets were never laid out for the car. We can offer people alternatives that are more fun."
Cars deserve to be banished from other places too, like the loop road on Central Park. Some of the lanes in Times Square and Fifth Avenue are badly needed by tourists now crowded into sidewalks. Buses and jitneys, maybe trolleys, would move more people with less noise and pollution if there were more special lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. (Taxis and private cars might also be allowed in some of these express lanes, but only if they paid a hefty premium.) There should be more lanes for bicyclists, who are now given less than 1 percent of the space on Manhattan's avenues. "The city is brilliantly constructed for riding bikes because it's so flat, compact and well lit at night," Komanoff says. "But there are only 100,000 riders a day now because of the fear of cars. With bike lanes on every avenue, there would easily be a million riders."
For most of New York's history, streets were supposed to serve people in the neighborhood, not vehicles speeding through. Sidewalk designs and street pavements were chosen and paid for by people living next to them. These "abutters" wanted wide sidewalks for socializing and playing. They made room for trees and flowers at the expense of noisy, polluting vehicles. To keep the streets safe and quiet, they chose pavements that would slow down traffic. But gradually the abutters' powers were relegated to bureaucrats more interested in improving traffic flow. Sidewalks narrowed and trees disappeared to make room for more lanes and parking spaces. In 1950, the longstanding ban on overnight parking was overturned. Merchants had supported the ban, and the city's police commissioner had denounced the idea of "the public streets being used as garages," but the lobbyists of the American Automobile Association prevailed. Soon the lovely old streetscapes were filled with rows of metal hulks, and some of the world's most valuable property was turned into free parking lots.
It's time for cars to pay their way and make room for the carless people who live here. Abutters of the city, unite! You have nothing to lose but their cars!

HEADLINE: RETHINK : Manifestoes For the Next New York; 
Development : And Why Not Bulldoze Lincoln Center?

BYLINE:  By Daniel Okrent; Daniel Okrent is writing a book about the history of Rockefeller Center.

 BODY:
As landmarks, they were unmistakable. As symbols, they were tragically alluring. And in the aftermath of their destruction, the towers of the World Trade Center have become justifiably sanctified, holy stations along the line of American memory that runs past Valley Forge and Gettysburg, Normandy and Iwo Jima.
 But it does not dishonor the dead or the grieving to say what has been unsaid: these were awful buildings. In their chilly blandness they corrupted the filigreed downtown skyline. In their vain gigantism, they confused "big" for "beautiful." The open space at their feet on all but the brightest days resembled a moonscape. Disconnected from the city's grid, the trade center wasn't even really part of New York. It was, instead, a hyperthyroid Stonehenge -- an urban freak. 
 A few years ago, the architectural historian Francis Morrone nailed it: he wrote that the trade center's sole virtue was that its observation decks were "the only high vantage points in New York from which the World Trade Center itself is not visible."
It's worth holding this image in mind, not allowing the distorting lens of emotion to alter our vision and lead us to reproduce what we have lost. There is a lot of rebuilding to be done, at ground zero as well as elsewhere in the city, and we have far superior models that show us not only what to do, but also how to do it. In fact, just four miles north of the trade center site stands the outstanding example of American urban design. And now, from the post-Sept. 11 perspective, its lessons are even more vivid. Born at a moment when the city was emotionally and financially devastated, Rockefeller Center became not only an engine of New York's recovery but also the symbol of its triumph. 
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed the project (and whose son, Nelson, should have known better than to be a key mover behind the trade center), got into it because the Metropolitan Opera had its eyes on a piece of land for a new house, which was not the same as being willing to pay for it. When 1929 collapsed with the crash, the Met withdrew and Rockefeller was stuck with a long-term lease on 12 acres of Midtown. He brought in a development buccaneer named John R. Todd -- grandfather, as it happens, of another local governor, Christie Whitman -- who knew that well-designed, pedestrian-friendly public space has the same effect on rents that helium has on balloons. And that the wish for economic success is a far more effective motivator of quality development than the best-laid plans of civic committees.
Todd and Rockefeller desired a profit, so they wanted what potential tenants wanted: something wonderful and something lasting. They took advantage of the Depression-devastated economy not by saving a buck on labor or materials, but by spending the original budget as planned, pouring dollars freed by dropping prices into extra wiring, more steel, all the qualitative components that would enhance the buildings' value for decades. In the process, they also employed nearly 75,000 people during the eight years of construction -- eight years in which Rockefeller Center was virtually the only private construction in New York. 
Today, more than 60 years after it opened, Rockefeller Center is as vital as it has ever been, and the profits it has made for its owners are as handsome as the place itself. It connects with the city around it, yet private maintenance helps it retain a distinctive character. The ingeniously situated skating rink -- an afterthought installed after shops in the "sunken plaza" had failed -- somehow lends the towering buildings around it a measure of intimacy. Even at midday, the cross streets are relatively calm, nearly benign, as in no other part of Midtown: the scores of trucks making deliveries to the center's buildings each day disappear down a ramp off 50th Street into a subterranean loading station. 
Someone once called Rockefeller Center "a city within a city"; more accurately, for all its imposing scale, it's a village within a city, one of the only places in New York that tourists and residents cohabit with neither self-consciousness nor sneers. 
It is too soon to say that the World Trade Center should be rebuilt as Rockefeller Center II. The anguished wound is too fresh to suture with architecture. But there's an opportunity, right now, to test the modern strength of the Rockefeller Center model. As the city suffers its sudden financial pain and as Lincoln Center's dysfunctional family bloodies itself in a series of public tantrums, it's time to forget about the proposed $1.5 billion renovation -- and simply tear the place down and begin again. If this frigid collection of architectural mishaps is not quite as soulless as the trade center, it certainly comes from the same design gulag. 
So imagine this: the city grants a 99-year lease on the necessary land to an imaginative private developer who is charged with creating an arts city. There must be theaters and concert halls, of course. But more, too: scattered among the halls, adding urban texture and pedestrian traffic, a collection of bookstores, art galleries, record shops and other businesses connected to the arts. Upstairs, rehearsal halls, Off-Broadway theaters, dance studios, art studios. On the highest floors, office space pitched directly to the cultural industries -- book publishers, theatrical agencies, arts foundations. 
The economic model, also derived from Rockefeller Center, is simple: subsidies for the tenants you really, really want -- a couple of bell-cow art galleries, say, whose very presence will attract their competitors (a scheme originally devised in the early 30's by a young Rock Center rental agent named Nelson Rockefeller). Maybe a favorite-son subsidy for locally owned retailers, to give the small bookstore a chance against the chains, and to New Yorkify the place. What pays for these subsidies? A permanent rental endowment gushing from the sale of the current Lincoln Center land. It would be fitting: the old Lincoln Center lives on in its financial contribution to the new one. And, way downtown, the World Trade Center lives on in the way it teaches us what not to do next.

 BODY:
Understanding the Mideast
A new lecture series at Yale, established to help bring about deeper understanding of conflicts in the Middle East, will be inaugurated with a talk by Martin Indyk, the former American ambassador to Israel. He will speak on Thursday at 8 p.m. in the Joseph Slifka Center for Jewish Life at Yale, 80 Wall Street.
 Mr. Indyk was appointed by President Clinton as National Security Council senior director for Near East and South Asia, participating in the development of policy toward the states of Iraq, Iran and Libya. 
 Admission is free. Information:(203) 432-1134.

Loft Artists Open House
The nonprofit Loft Artists Association of Stamford holds its annual open house today from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Stamford Industrial Park, 737 Canal Street. Originally a work-cum-exhibition space for a handful of painters, photographers and graphic artists, its membership has grown and broadened to include some 60 men and women who represent a broad spectrum of the visual and performing arts.
At 2 p.m. the Chalasa Dance Theater and the Renee Kahn Repertory Company will present a Jean Cocteau mime play, followed by a performance by the Ballet School of Stamford. Admission is free.

Depression Era Photos
Forty-five black and white and color prints produced during the Great Depression under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration are at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich through Nov. 25. "Prints of American Life: W.P.A. Works on Paper" captures an era when unemployed workers were kept afloat financially through federal aid. 
After establishing need and passing examinations determining ability, artists, writers, theater groups and musicians were provided with a living wage in conformance with the Federal Arts Project of 1935.
Etchings, lithographs, wood engravings, and silk screens are in this exhibition, in styles that hewed mostly to realism. Modern art forms in Europe were not considered appropriate for works that were to reflect the lives of ordinary Americans. 
Admission is $4 for adults, $3 for children and adults over 64. Information:(203) 869-0376.

Music at Yale
A free program of English lute songs and madrigals performed by Catherine Liddell, a lutenist, will be heard today at Yale. The Yale singers and guitarists and the Yale Collegium Musicum will also play. Curtain time is 2 p.m. at the Yale Center for British Art.

All About Mellon
Paul Mellon, founder of the Yale Center for British Art, will be the subject of a lecture by Rosamond Bernier on Thursday at 5:30 p.m. Titled "Paul Mellon: A Discerning Collector with a Genius for Giving," the talk will be held at the Yale University Art Gallery and admission is free.

Listening to Stories
Two hours of storytelling presented as five dramatized stories for adults begins on Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Unitarian Church in Westport. Tellebration 2001 is the 13th such confluence of storytellers sponsored by the Connecticut Storytelling Center and the 41-state National Storytelling Network. Tickets are $10 in advance or $12 at the door, including a post-tellebration reception. Proceeds are used for programs and workshops in schools, libraries and community groups. Reservations: (203) 255-5710.

Inside the Machine
Edith Kramer, a Viennese artist who studied at the Bauhaus before coming to the United States in the late 30's, worked as a machinist during World War II. She received permission to draw the machinery after her shift was over, eventually amassing a collection of pen and ink sketches that documented the small, specialized machine shop of the 40's.
An exhibition of her work, titled "Industrial New York," may be seen at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield through next Sunday. In addition to the drawings, her oils and watercolors of industrial sites all over the city have been exhibited across the country and abroad. Hours and directions: (203) 365-7650. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
Florio Sees a Budget Mess, But Not as Bad as His Was

BYLINE:  By David M. Halbfinger; David M. Halbfinger is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
Jim from Metuchen was on the line again. He'd called in to a radio station after the first gubernatorial debate last month with a scathing analysis of Bret D. Schundler's performance: "stunningly uninformed, and embarrassingly superficial," he'd said in that distinctive acid tone.
 Now he was talking on the telephone about the governor-elect, James E. McGreevey. About what it was like to inherit budget deficits. About what it was like to be harangued by angry Republicans. 
 Jim Florio knows whereof he speaks.
Twelve years ago, after all, he steamrolled into office after crushing James Courter by 24 percentage points. But his response to a yawning budget deficit -- a $2.8 billion tax increase -- gave rise to a Republican revolt that made him a one-term governor and drove New Jersey Democrats into the political desert.
"His deficit's going to be more substantial than mine," Mr. Florio was saying now about Mr. McGreevey's inheritance: a shortfall in the current year of more than $700 million, and projections in the next fiscal year of a $2 billion deficit.
"The part I think he has a little bit of an advantage on," Mr. Florio said, "is that everybody understands these things are coming. My situation was, there was no understanding, no discussion. I mean, Governor Kean left office pronouncing in public that he was leaving me a $300 million surplus. And when it turned out to be a $600 million shortfall in the year that we were in, that was just -- nobody paid attention until I announced it, and all of a sudden it's now Florio's problem. I think this time it'll be a little less exclusively McGreevey's problem, which is a big benefit."
So what does Mr. McGreevey do, since he is promising not to raise taxes and campaigned on a pledge to lower state debt?
"Out of the box, the options are to bring a higher degree of efficiency to government and whatever, all the rhetoric," Mr. Florio said. "The problem is that the big-ticket items in terms of economizing are local assistance, school assistance, and that's not going to be a pleasant process, to get those things down."
Cutting local aid does little but drive property taxes up -- not a sure-fire way to mount a re-election campaign, as Christie Whitman learned.
The crucible for Mr. McGreevey and the newly rebalanced Legislature, Mr. Florio said, will come when he proposes cuts that affect the groups that helped to elect him.
"He's going to submit, undoubtedly, a budget with integrity," Mr. Florio said. "It may be a painful budget. And if in fact the Legislature says, 'We can't handle all these cuts, it's against the public interest, therefore you've got to find some way of getting more revenues,' they will have to go and bite the bullet."
Mr. Florio, who learned a painful lesson about the value of salesmanship when proposing strong fiscal medicine, said that Mr. McGreevey, if he had to do the same, would be able to draw on that fateful 1990 experience, his own unique skills and the unusual boon of an unusually friendly departing governor.
Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, he said, "could be a great help if he wants to, by having the Treasury Department come forward with their authoritative update of what the deficit is, so that this is not something that's partisan, this is something that's acknowledged by everyone."
As for his potential as a salesman, Mr. Florio pointed to Mr. McGreevey's discipline in the campaign.
"Even some of the press people are writing that he's overly scripted," he said. "Well, he has the intelligence to write the right script and be able to go out and deliver it."
The biggest danger, Mr. Florio warned, could come from Mr. McGreevey's vanquished Republican opponent, Bret D. Schundler.
"What was most troubling to me the other night," Mr. Florio said, "was his sort of campaign harangue in his concession speech."
Mr. Florio said he expected Mr. Schundler, lacking the platform of a public office, to use the news media as a megaphone to harass Mr. McGreevey.
"He's going to be out there," he said. "And frankly, you folks will all give him a forum. You'll have no choice. He'll call a press conference and he'll say things in very picturesque ways, in colorful ways, in denunciations of things."
It was not lost on Mr. Florio, of course, that Mr. Schundler spent the home stretch of his campaign employing a not unfamiliar campaign strategy: likening Mr. McGreevey to Mr. Florio, and conjuring up the 1990 tax increases to appeal to taxpayers' fears.
But Mr. Florio said he believed that just as tarring Democrats as liberals had lost its oomph, the Florio stigma, used over and over by Republican candidates at every level in the last 10 years, had at last lost its punch.
"I think what you're going to see is this is the last time," he said, "because it's just becoming more and more transparent that trying to beat up on -- whether it be me, or the policies of 11 years ago now -- there's transparently an effort not to want to address the things that you have to address now. This is a wonderful example of how you almost are colossally insensitive to the fact that it was something of ancient history for most people.
"So I think it has run its course," he said.
So, Mr. Florio was asked, you can now rest easy in your political grave?
"Well, I think I would put it in a different way."

HEADLINE: With Sagging Economy as Ally, Democrats in Congress Go on the Attack 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
The halls of Congress will reverberate with shouts of "big corporations," "class warfare," and "bioterrorism" next week, unless the phrase "point of order" drowns them out.
 With the bipartisanship of September in tatters, Democrats are on the attack in both houses, sensing that a sagging economy will help them in next year's elections and that they can paint Republicans as insensitive to distress. 
 In the Senate they are pushing a $66.4 billion economic stimulus bill tilted heavily toward direct help for the unemployed.
Republicans argue that tax cuts for people with high incomes and corporations will lead to investments that create more jobs. Some also contend that pushing a plan that President Bush opposes verges on the unpatriotic. And they regularly condemned the Democrats for pushing ahead without trying for a compromise with them. 
"Power politics," complained Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska.
The Senate battle lines may seem familiar enough, but in the House, Democrats will be trying to outflank Republicans by contending that the country needs to spend more on homeland defense, from protection from biological terrorism to more money for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That fight will be over adding money to the defense appropriations bill. The Republicans may stick with President Bush and block that spending, but they seem less likely to be able to thwart a bid for $11 billion more for New York City.
In the House, the Rules Committee can always erect barriers to results that the Republican leaders oppose. In the Senate, though, the rules are already there, and it will take 60 votes to allow the Democratic plan (or a Republican alternative or a centrist compromise) to go forward.
The issue would not arise over a filibuster, which could make the side forcing delay look bad, but over a point of order raised under the 1974 Budget Act.
The procedural objection would be that no stimulus bill was authorized by the joint budget resolution passed earlier this year. Republicans insist that they plan to use that rule to kill the Democratic bill, so they can make the majority sit down and negotiate.
Ron Bonjean, press secretary for Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the minority leader, said, "Senator Lott and the Republicans think this is nothing but a pork barrel bill that does nothing to stimulate the economy."
But nothing Republicans can do will preclude at last some debate on the issue, and Democrats will concentrate their fire on one element in the House bill -- about $16 billion in refunds to big corporations for payments in the last 15 years under the alternative minimum tax, enacted in 1986 to ensure that big companies paid at least some taxes. (A Senate Republican plan would also eliminate the tax, but only in the future.)
Democrats were citing some of the big beneficiaries this week and saying what could be done with the money instead of giving it back. Senator Barbara Boxer of California, for example, said that with the $1.4 billion for I.B.M. and the $1 billion for Ford "you could vaccinate every man, woman and child in America against smallpox."
Even if the corporate rebate checks are not part of some eventual legislation, Democrats plan to use the idea against Republicans next fall. Jim Jordan, executive director of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, called the plan "ostentatiously bad politics."
"It's amazing," Mr. Jordan said, "how the Republicans go out of their way to prove they are the party of rich folks and corporations."
The Republican strategy is two-pronged. The first is to demand that the Democrats be bipartisan and negotiate (to which the Democrats reply that they do not want to negotiate first with Senate Republicans and then with the House). The second is to denounce the Democratic bill over various items in it, like $5 billion for farmers or in a $20 billion spending amendment that the senator who assembled it, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, says will protect the nation from bioterrorism and increase security for nuclear plants.
For example, Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican conference, this week called the Democratic plan just "a special interest grab bag."
Democrats sounded undeterred. On Friday, with most of their colleagues away for a long weekend, several Democratic senators prepared for next week by taking oratorical batting practice.
Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said the House Republican bill amounted to "a great deal of tax relief for the biggest corporations in America."
"This is profiteering in the name of patriotism," Mr. Durbin said.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said the time had come "to put national interests ahead of narrow partisan interests" and support the Democratic bill.
Senator Byrd, whose hard-won reputation for looking after his state leads some people to call him a pork-barrel politician, said the House bill was "the epitome of pork."
"It drips, it drips with lard," Mr. Byrd said.
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, attacked what she called the "big, irresponsible giveaways that the House engaged in." Like Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Clinton contended that tax cuts would not be spent but that extra unemployment benefits would be.
"If there is any dollar that will be spent immediately into our economy," she said, "it is unemployment insurance."
The only Republican around to answer them was Senator Murkowski. "What we're going to see next week," he said, "is almost a class warfare on the issue of the stimulus."
He said the way to stimulate the economy was not federal spending but tax cuts that would encourage the wealthy to invest.
The best stimulus plan of all, Mr. Murkowski said, would be to allow drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which he said would create 250,000 jobs.

Another Useful Crisis

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Remember California's energy crisis? It illustrated, in particularly stark form, the political strategy of the Bush administration before Sept. 11. The basic principle of this strategy -- which was also used to sell that $2 trillion tax cut -- was that crises weren't problems to be solved. Instead, they were opportunities to advance an agenda that had nothing to do with the crisis at hand.
 It is now clear that, at least as far as domestic policy is concerned, the administration views terrorism as another useful crisis. 
 Let's recall the California story. Between November 2000 and June 2001 -- or, if you prefer, between last year's election and James Jeffords's defection, which gave the Democrats control of the Senate -- a shortage of electric generating capacity, exacerbated by the puzzling fact that much of this capacity stood idle, led to power outages and extremely high prices.
The appropriate response was obvious. First, encourage conservation until new capacity could be added; second, temporarily cap prices, both to limit the financial damage and to discourage power companies from manipulating the market.
But Dick Cheney dismissed conservation as a mere "sign of personal virtue," and administration officials waved aside pleas for a price ceiling. Instead, they used California's woes to push for large subsidies to the coal industry, and, of course, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We never did learn what all this had to do with electricity generation.
Eventually, price controls were imposed, and the idle capacity mysteriously came back on line; meanwhile, conservation led to a sharp drop in demand, and the crisis evaporated.
Now to the present. After Sept. 11, we need to spend substantial sums on reconstruction and homeland security, and the sagging economy could use a temporary stimulus. But George W. Bush has threatened to veto any additional domestic spending beyond the $40 billion already agreed upon -- "We wage a war to save civilization itself," he declared on Thursday, but apparently this war must not cost more than 0.4 percent of G.D.P. And the administration favors "stimulus" proposals that have nothing to do with helping the economy, but everything to do with its usual tax-cutting agenda.
The stimulus package introduced by Senate Democrats isn't perfect, by a long shot -- it contains billions of dollars for things like agricultural price supports, which don't belong there. But at least $70 billion of its $90 billion is real stimulus, in the form of temporary investment incentives, temporary grants of income support and medical care to the unemployed, and checks to low-income families who are likely to spend them.
The administration, however, favors the Senate Republicans' proposal; while that bill is less lurid than the one passed by the House, with its huge retroactive tax cuts for big corporations (according to Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush was "pleased" with the House bill), over all it's just as bad. It would cost $220 billion over three years; less than $20 billion of that total seems to have anything to do with economic stimulus. 
The rest of the proposal consists of tax cuts for corporations and high-income individuals, structured in such a way that they will do little to increase spending during the current recession. For example, tax incentives for investment are valid not for one year -- as in the Democratic bill -- but for three years; this is an open invitation to companies not to invest now, when the economy needs a boost, but instead to delay investments until the economy has already recovered. 
Why does the administration's favored bill offer so little stimulus? Because that's not its purpose: it's really designed to lock in permanent tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, using the Sept. 11 attacks as an excuse. 
Ten months into the Bush administration, we've all gotten used to this. But politics, while never completely clean, didn't used to be this cynical. We used to see bills like the Democratic stimulus package: mostly serving their ostensible purpose, with the special-interest add-ons a distinctly secondary feature. It's something new to see crises -- especially a crisis as shocking as the terrorist attack -- consistently addressed with legislation that does almost nothing to address the actual problem, and is almost entirely aimed at advancing a pre-existing agenda. 
Oh, by the way: the administration is once again pushing for drilling in the Arctic. You see, it's essential to the fight against terrorism.

HEADLINE: Russia's Germ Warfare Secrets 

 BODY:
A top Russian scientist issued a little-noticed warning last week that impoverished experts from Russia's former biological weapons programs may be up for sale to any terrorist organization willing to pay the price. As the United States mobilizes to develop defenses against bioterrorism, it urgently needs reliable intelligence on just what has happened to the people and materials that gave the Soviet Union the most frightening arsenal of biological weapons ever developed. A more vigorous effort to bring Russian expertise, weapons formulas and biological materials under better control should be on the agenda this week when President Bush meets with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. 
 The scale and variety of the Soviet program were stunning. In a cynical betrayal of international trust, Moscow took the signing of a biological weapons convention in 1972 as the signal to start a clandestine crash program to expand its biological weaponry, not abandon such weapons as required. At its peak, in the late 1980's, the program involved a vast complex of production plants and research facilities, employed some 60,000 scientists and technicians, and produced thousands of tons of anthrax and hundreds of tons of smallpox and plague, among some 50 biological agents that were studied as weapons. Soviet scientists also worked out ways to make some germ weapons impervious to antibiotics and did genetic engineering experiments that suggested a desire to combine Ebola and smallpox to make an especially fearsome weapon. 
 Then, in a 1992 change of course, Russia announced that it was terminating its germ-warfare program and dismantling its production lines. Western experts were subsequently allowed in to inspect several of the sites. But no one knows for sure whether or not some of the lethal stocks were stolen and smuggled out of the country or whether some of the unemployed scientists and technicians have sold their services to rogue nations or even terrorist groups. There are credible if anecdotal reports of Russian scientists going to Iran, Iraq and North Korea. There are also concerns that Russian military scientists may still be conducting secret research on biological weapons. The Kremlin has refused to let outsiders visit some of the former military sites.
The United States badly needs more information on the whereabouts of key scientists, engineers and materials from the former Soviet biological weapons complex. That could help determine what biological dangers may be loose in the world and thus what threats require the most urgent attention in homeland defenses. Moscow could surely help obtain such information from individuals who worked at the former weapons sites. 
If Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin genuinely want to contain biological terrorism, it should be possible to craft a deal. For his part, Mr. Bush could expand a program that already awards grants for civilian research to scientists who worked in the Soviet chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs. The goal is to prevent the drain of weapons talent from Russia to rogue nations or terrorist groups. Mr. Putin needs to open his last remaining biological warfare facilities to inspection and help determine whether any experts and materials have already escaped.

HEADLINE: THE NATION; 
Breaking the Laws in New York City

BYLINE:  By JAMES TRAUB; James Traub writes frequently about New York City and its politics.

 BODY:
UNTIL very recently, virtually the entire community of political handicappers in New York viewed the mayoral candidacy of Michael R. Bloomberg as a self-indulgent lark. Just two weeks ago, even one of his close advisers was arguing that if Mr. Bloomberg did better than Ruth W. Messinger, a Democrat who won 42 percent of the vote in 1997, that should be deemed a moral victory. This was so not only because of Mr. Bloomberg's obvious limitations as a first-time candidate, but because of the immutable laws of New York politics. Here is how several of those laws were articulated by political experts this summer:
 "The only time Republicans get elected mayor is when Democrats are angry at the Democratic incumbent or angry at the people running the party." 
 "You can buy an election in New Jersey, where media is so expensive and free media is so ineffectual; but you can't buy an election that way in New York." 
"New Yorkers are not enormously impressed with business experience."
One of the questions raised by Mr. Bloomberg's stunning victory is whether any of those laws still hold. 
If Mr. Bloomberg is embarking on a new life, the Democrats are going through a kind of identity crisis. New York has been essentially a one-party town since the rise of Tammany Hall in the mid-19th century, and Mr. Bloomberg is the first Republican in New York history to succeed another Republican. "Politics has now been individualized," says Hank Sheinkopf, a consultant whose clients included Mark Green. "The long death of the party organizations and the influence of consultants and money have made that a fact."
New Yorkers continue to vote Democratic in other races, but in apparent violation of the first law, both moderate-to-conservative white democratic voters and more liberal Hispanics crossed party lines to vote for Mr. Bloomberg. (That he was a lifelong Democrat who switched, he said, because "You cannot as a wealthy guy get the Democratic nomination," made it easier.) 
What was unique about this election was the willingness of Hispanics, traditionally loyal Democrats, to vote G.O.P. Many of them were disgusted with Mr. Green for what they considered racially loaded campaign tactics in his primary against Fernando Ferrer, but they could have stayed home. It appears that Hispanic voters in New York, like those in Florida, Texas and elsewhere, are now open to Republican candidates. 
The rationale for the second law is as follows: In most areas, a media blitz can overwhelm local coverage. In New Jersey, for example, Jon Corzine, a former head of Goldman Sachs, was elected to the Senate after spending $63 million on TV ads. But in New York City, with four daily newspapers, weekly magazines, local TV affiliates and a television news station all its own, free media trumps paid.
And yet Mr. Bloomberg did it. There were times over the summer when campaign coverage seemed to consist exclusively of a sort of Bloomberg Gaffe Watch. But it didn't matter. Mr. Bloomberg was able to shape his public image as a pragmatic, no-nonsense business leader through a series of well-crafted television commercials that ran 6,500 times. And if even in the most clamorous media market in the country a candidate can spend his way to victory, then the "self-financed" candidate is bound to be the wave of the future everywhere.
Is it true? Many experts believe that a bizarre convergence of events and phenomena -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's outsized personality, the catastrophe of Sept. 11, war preparations, anthrax, the World Series -- distracted readers and thus exaggerated the value of paid media. The Democrats hope so.
THE third adage goes to the heart of the city's political tradition. "Politics" has become a dirty word in most of America. It is what you run against. Even a state like Minnesota, with its progressive political traditions, has the former wrestler Jesse Ventura as governor. In New York, politics is still an noble calling, and the Democrat, Mark Green, confidently mocked Mr. Bloomberg as an amateur. But Mr. Bloomberg called himself "a leader, not a politician," and it worked. 
Ken Sunshine, an adviser to Mr. Green, said that he was shocked that Mr. Bloomberg's gaffes were not held against him. The public attitude, he said, was, "He's not like a slick politician who would have thought before speaking." At the same time, despite Mr. Green's long record of public service and mastery of policy, Mr. Bloomberg successfully argued that Mr. Green lacked the skills to cut the budget and rebuild the city. 
Why he succeeded is suggested by exit polls. Only 26 percent of Mr. Bloomberg's voters said that he "understands the city and its problems." Just 38 percent thought he had "the right experience" to govern. Mr. Green won easily on both counts. But Mr. Bloomberg won when voters were asked if their candidate "would be strong in a crisis" and "is not a typical politician." 
The figures imply a dim view of politics as a profession, as well as an almost naive faith in corporate managerial gifts. Coincidentally, perhaps, the two other city officials elected on Tuesday, Betsy Gotbaum as public advocate and William C. Thompson as comptroller, had never held elective office before either. 
Mark Penn, a pollster whose firm worked for Mr. Bloomberg, points out that Mark Warner, another wealthy entrepreneur, was just elected governor of Virginia by offering precisely what Mr. Bloomberg offered New Yorkers: "Business acumen at a time of economic decline." Mr. Warner is a Democrat in a Republican state, and Mr. Penn argues that voters are not so much devaluing politicians as matching the candidates to the demands of the moment. 
The notion that politicians are suitable for business-as-usual, while businessmen should handle crises, would certainly have surprised the dauntless Fiorello LaGuardia, who led New York through the Depression, or F.D.R. They understood that political leadership is an art form, a public act, very different from "management." It is, Mr. Bloomberg may soon discover, harder than it looks.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE GATEKEEPERS; 
Adept in Politics and Advertising, 4 Women Shape a Campaign

BYLINE:  By PETER MARKS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Twenty-four hours after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, President Bush summoned his close aide Karen P. Hughes, telling her that the job of coordinating wartime public relations for the government would be hers.
 "When he called me in that morning, he told me that this will be an ongoing process of educating the public," said Ms. Hughes, counselor to the president. "He said, 'O.K., go for it.' " 
 In the following weeks, Ms. Hughes, a former television reporter in Texas who led media operations in the Bush presidential campaign, has settled into the role of chief keeper of the message. She works closely with three other women: Victoria Clarke, chief Pentagon spokeswoman; Charlotte Beers, under secretary of state for public diplomacy; and Mary Matalin, chief political adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney.
The four are among the Bush administration's most important shapers of the words and images that the allies are seeking to convey to a global audience. (Others include Ari Fleischer, the president's press secretary, and James Wilkinson, a Hughes deputy who has set up a comprehensive center to counter Taliban propaganda.) They talk several times a day -- including a daily 9:30 a.m. agenda-setting conference call, presided over by Ms. Hughes -- and bounce ideas off one another frequently.
In the male-dominated machinery of war, it is a rarity, even in enlightened times, to find so many women in highly visible roles with the responsibility for trying to influence public opinion about military operations and other aspects of a conflict.
And their relationship is even more unusual, founded in the deep connections at least three of them forged in long stints in Republican politics and on the campaign trail.
"Three of us have not worked together in just this war," said Ms. Matalin, who is perhaps the best known of the team, as a longtime adviser to Mr. Bush's father, a Republican commentator on television and the wife of James Carville, a Democratic political consultant. 
Of the four, Ms. Matalin, 48, also enjoys perhaps the warmest relations with Washington reporters. She also speaks warmly of the intimacy she feels in working with the other women. "I know how Torie thinks," she said, invoking Ms. Clarke's nickname. "I know what Karen thinks. We skip right past the pleasantries."
If the nature of the collaboration is unusual, so is the nature of the event. "This is a very uncommon war," said Ms. Clarke, who worked in the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain of Arizona last year and was press secretary to Mr. Bush's father in his unsuccessful bid for re-election in 1992.
"This is not just about military matters," she added, explaining that the scope of the conflict requires the message makers to consider diplomacy, economics and law.
The women have other common pursuits. Like the other three, Ms. Beers, 66, who did not return calls seeking comment, also comes from the world of image making, but her background is Madison Avenue, rather than Pennsylvania Avenue. She is the former chairwoman of the giant advertising agencies Ogilvy & Mather and J. Walter Thompson. Ms. Clarke, too, once worked in advertising, as president of Bozell Eskew Advertising, which specializes in issue advocacy and corporate communications.
That they share a background in selling images or ideas may be fortunate, some political observers say. "In some ways, the challenge this White House team faces is very similar to being in a political campaign," said Martin Kaplan, a former chief speechwriter for Vice President Walter F. Mondale and now associate dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California.
Although some in the administration acknowledge privately that in the early weeks after the attacks, the allies were slow to develop a response to statements by Taliban officials, Ms. Hughes and others say that a strategy is taking root. In the coming weeks, Ms. Hughes said, the press operations, under a newly formed umbrella group, the Coalition Information Center, will highlight issues, like the Taliban's treatment of women, that cast the Afghan leadership in a negative light. The first lady, Laura Bush, is expected to be enlisted as a leading voice of that information campaign, she added.
Ms. Matalin said it was perhaps not a coincidence that such issues would be front and center.
"I think we probably bring -- and I don't mean this to sound sexist -- but we probably have more of a subconscious outrage at these issues," she said. "This is something that crosses my mind every day: a third of these women in pre-Taliban days were doctors, lawyers and teachers. You can't help but be outraged."

HEADLINE: 'Fog of War' Marks Campaign as Australia Re-elects Leadership 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SHAW 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Prime Minister John Howard and his conservative government won a third term today in national elections that focused on security and immigration issues. 
 Mr. Howard, 62, who took a hard-line stance against illegal immigration and emphasized his support for the American-led war against terrorism, won with an increased majority, according to counts by election officials and computer projections by news media analysts. 
 With 80 percent of the vote counted, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Mr. Howard's Liberal Party had won 67 seats in the 150-seat lower house of Parliament. Its junior coalition partner, the National Party, won 12 seats, giving them a majority. The rival Labor Party, led by Kim Beazley, 52, a former defense minister, won 65 seats, the network reported. 
Australians also chose lawmakers for 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate. 
Mr. Beazley, who has led his party for six years, conceded defeat and withdrew from the leadership, saying, "We fought in the adverse circumstances of the fog of war."
The re-election of the Howard government will consolidate Australia's cordial official links with the United States. "All of us are deeply conscious of the changes that have come over the world and therefore over our nation since the terrible events in the United States of Sept. 11," Mr. Howard said.
Labor's promises for modest improvements in health, education, tax and welfare programs were not enough to oust a government that oversaw six years of general economic progress. 
A clear majority of the 12 million voters approved of Mr. Howard's prompt commitment of a 1,500-strong Australian force to support the American war effort in Afghanistan and also of his recent refusal to grant asylum to nearly 2,000 refugees from Muslim countries.
Elected to Parliament in 1972, Mr. Howard is the fourth Australian prime minister to win a third term.He is perceived as being more conservative than many of his colleagues on issues like reconciliation with the Aborigines, the indigenous black minority, and the nation's evolution to a republic, severing ceremonial ties to the British monarchy. 
His foreign policy priority will be to improve relations with neighboring Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, which has been accused of tolerating smugglers that ferry Muslim refugees and economic migrants into Australian waters. 
Throughout the five-week election campaign, reports of the 2,000 asylum seekers on about a dozen boats that were turned back by the navy or shipped to detention camps, received extensive coverage, reinforcing the government's emphasis on border protection and overshadowing Labor's focus on social reforms.
The Labor Party held a slim advantage in opinion polls until August when Mr. Howard's rating surged by 15 percentage points after he refused entry to the asylum seekers. Most were refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and other Muslim countries seeking asylum in Australia. 
Australia grants only three-year "temporary protection" visas to unauthorized arrivals deemed to be genuine refugees but gives full rights to about 12,000 United Nations-authorized refugees each year.
About 1,200 candidates from three mainstream parties and three minor groups, including environmentalist and watchdog activists, sought election to the House of Representatives where the government had held a seven-seat margin since re-election in 1998.

HEADLINE: Putin Urges A 'New Level' Of the Trust With America 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Days before a much-anticipated meeting with President Bush, President Vladimir V. Putin called tonight for Russia and the United States to bury the vestiges of their cold war suspicions and form an alliance with "a qualitatively new level" of trust.
 Underscoring that, he said emphatically that Russia did not regard the mushrooming role of the United States in Central Asia, the heartland of the former Soviet Union, as either a strategic or an economic threat. 
 While he offered no details, Mr. Putin also said he was "very optimistic" that the two nations would eventually strike a deal to rewrite the 30-year-old rules of nuclear-arms control fundamentally. 
In a broad-ranging interview with American journalists in the Kremlin's presidential library, Mr. Putin clearly intended to set a high tone for his American visit, which includes a two-day stopover at Mr. Bush's ranch in Texas next week.
He said several times that he felt not only that he and Mr. Bush had established a close personal relationship, but also that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States had given their nations a common cause and the seeds of a lasting alliance.
"We would like our joint struggle against terrorism to lead to positive results, that terrorism not only in Afghanistan but the entire world be destroyed, uprooted, liquidated," Mr. Putin said. Only a coordinated strategy will allow civilized nations to respond quickly and adequately to what promises to be a long campaign against terrorists, he said.
"It is quite obvious to any objective observer," he said, "that we can find an effective response to these challenges only if we pull our efforts together."
Beyond that, Mr. Putin said both nations must shed "the fears of the past" linked to their cold war rivalry, and accept that they now share not only democratic values and ambitions, but also the same commitment to market economics. 
Americans who think otherwise, he said, "simply do not understand the way the world has changed."
Perhaps his most striking example was Russia's new attitude in the former Soviet nations of Central Asia, where the growing American military presence has convinced many Russian military officials and private experts that Washington wants to push Moscow out of its historic sphere of influence.
Mr. Putin rejected that argument as an example of cold war thinking that automatically pits the United States and Russia as rivals. In fact, he said, their common cause against terrorism and their increasing cooperation in developing oil fields in the area make clear that they have common interests.
"What was important in the former system of coordinates and the former reference framework now is losing its importance," he said. "If Russia is now becoming a full-fledged member of the international community, then we must not fear, and we will not fear, the development of relations between its neighbors and other countries and nations."
"The times have long gone when Russia viewed the world as needing a confrontational approach," he said. "We are not for this. We are quite the opposite now." 
He also called for Russia and the United States to move toward settlements on other issues that have divided them, led by the yearlong standoff over Washington's plans to build a limited national missile defense.
He said Russia was prepared to negotiate changes in the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which prohibits national defenses against missiles, "when we see specific options" from American experts, something he said had yet to occur.
"It will be up to the political leaders to make a choice between different options, and I am very optimistic that they can be found," he said.
Mr. Putin reiterated Russia's opposition to a proposal that would expand the NATO alliance to include three Baltic nations -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which once were part of the Soviet Union.
But at the same time, he suggested that a shift of NATO's mission away from the purely defensive alliance that once opposed Soviet force, and toward a group that combats international terrorism and weapons proliferation, could "rekindle the nature of the alliance."
Russia could offer a great deal to such an organization, he said.
"I can tell you frankly that I have certain ideas of a general nature," he said. "I can't elaborate on them now, but they are very promising."
Asked tonight whether he believed a claim by Osama bin Laden that the Qaeda organization possesses nuclear and chemical weapons, Mr. Putin said such statements were generally made in an attempt to sow panic. He said he was certain that none of Russia's weapons of mass destruction had fallen into terrorist hands.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Recipe: Luck, Lots of Cash and a Hands-On Role 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
Thirty-six hours before the polls opened on Election Day, a wave of gloom swept through the Republican mayoral campaign of Michael R. Bloomberg. After a steady climb in the opinion polls, the race was suddenly threatening to slip away. 
 The problem was a politically explosive brochure being distributed in support of Mr. Bloomberg by Republicans in Staten Island. In some ways it was not unlike racially charged materials used against Fernando Ferrer by supporters of Mark Green in the final days of the Democratic runoff. Mr. Bloomberg had denounced that effort and the Staten Island brochure threatened to cast him as a hypocrite. 
 "It hit like a bullet," said William Cunningham, a top Bloomberg strategist. 
Said another campaign staff member: "I actually did think the race was over."
That the race was not over is very much the story of Mr. Bloomberg's astonishing evolution from a first-time and sometimes clumsy candidate to mayor-elect of the nation's biggest and most complex city. There was a lot of luck. There was a lot of money and high-priced strategy. And there was a lot of Mr. Bloomberg's being a hands-on manager who liked a good fight, but who had imposed one cardinal rule about his campaign: he would not sacrifice his good name to win the election. This triple combination helped navigate the candidacy through a series of rocky moments over five months of campaigning that might easily have sunk other candidacies, and that nearly took his down as well.
As it turned out, some of Mr. Bloomberg's biggest doubters were regulars at 126 East 56th Street, where the eventual victor's campaign was based. As late as 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday, one of Mr. Bloomberg's paid consultants was quietly telling reporters at the Bloomberg party at the B. B. King Blues Club and Grill on West 42nd Street that Mr. Green would win. Meanwhile, across the street at the Hilton, Mr. Cunningham was contemplating the makings of a legal team in case the election ended up in court.
In a suite down the hall, Mr. Bloomberg was working on his speech, which he had crafted into three versions: win, lose and too close to call. Despite having made billions in the news-information and computer industries, his words were handwritten, as was his custom throughout the campaign. Even the election results, as they came in by telephone that night, were scribbled on a yellow pad with a felt pen.
"Mike is a very big boy," said David Garth, Mr. Bloomberg's top strategist, who would offer only hints about his candidate's expectations for the night. "He understands reality. He knew from the beginning what he was getting himself into."
As for himself, Mr. Garth was unequivocal. He always thought that Mr. Bloomberg would lose. He was not persuaded otherwise until after midnight on Wednesday.
"I thought we were going to have a terrific race and lose by about five points," Mr. Garth said.
As circumstances would have it, the worst act of terrorism in American history would not only make Mr. Bloomberg's private-sector credentials more appealing to the electorate, but it would also turn his most influential backer -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- into a national hero. "When Rudy put his arm around Mike, literally, that was the campaign," Mr. Garth said.
As money would have it, Mr. Bloomberg would break campaign spending records by pouring at least $41 million of his personal fortune into the race. The money bought him people like Mr. Garth and Mr. Cunningham who, together, cost Mr. Bloomberg about $1 million. It also allowed him to bypass a press corps he regarded as hostile.
He swamped the postal system with targeted direct mail, some of it in Spanish, and sent videotapes to individual voters. He bought advertisements in ethnic and community newspapers in all five boroughs. And he inundated the airwaves with a variety of commercials, including one featuring Mr. Giuliani that appeared several times in high-priced slots during the late innings of the World Series.
"He didn't poor-mouth you over the money and didn't complain," Mr. Garth said. "His attitude was don't cut unless it was not helpful to the campaign."
And as Mr. Bloomberg would have it, he would not be intimidated by his rookie political status, picking and choosing the advice of his veteran campaign staff and generally exercising control over his own destiny. His decisions sometimes frustrated his advisers -- when, for example, he rejected some hard-hitting advertisements against Mr. Green -- but he said he was most comfortable living with his own mistakes.
"There are times that it gets frustrating and you want to tear your hair out," Mr. Bloomberg said on his final day of campaigning. "But the faults in the campaign are mine, not my staff. My staff has done everything I could ever ask for."
Last Sunday, it was his staff that first confronted the looming crisis in Staten Island. As reporters began calling with questions about the brochure -- which featured pictures of Mr. Green with former Mayor David N. Dinkins, the city's first black mayor, and contained some ominous language about their relationship -- several of Mr. Bloomberg's closest advisers convened an urgent meeting on the seventh floor of the East 56th Street headquarters. It was around dinnertime and Mr. Bloomberg was campaigning in Queens, first with former Mayor Edward I. Koch and then with Gov. George E. Pataki. He would be filled in when he returned to Manhattan.
Mr. Cunningham was at the meeting. Among the others were Patricia E. Harris, Kevin Sheekey, Edward Skyler and Vincent Lapadula. Calls were put out to Leticia Remauro, the Republican Party chairwoman in Staten Island, and to Christopher Hellstrom, the campaign's borough coordinator there. Though some details were hazy, the information gleaned from those telephone conversations made for some of the most anxious hours of the campaign.
Ms. Remauro had indeed printed and distributed the brochures and Mr. Hellstrom, while apparently not involved, had been aware of what she had done and had not passed the information along. It was even possible that some brochures had been distributed to Mr. Bloomberg's volunteers from the campaign's Staten Island office.
"I thought we were dead," one campaign staff member said. "We needed to bring it to resolution that night and make Mike look more positive than negative."
Mr. Lapadula, who is from Staten Island and who had worked for Mayor Giuliani before joining the campaign, was sent to Staten Island, where he fired Mr. Hellstrom that night. Ms. Remauro was told to pull back the literature. A fax went to the state Republican Party demanding the same.
And when Mr. Bloomberg returned to Manhattan, he reacted swiftly, using a scheduled radio interview that night to denounce the brochure and express outrage and unhappiness with the turn of events. The next morning, he called Mr. Dinkins. "I felt personally insulted and apologized to him," Mr. Bloomberg said of their conversation.
As things turned out, the incident was not the candidate killer that Mr. Bloomberg's staff had feared. In fact, it was almost forgotten by the time the polls opened on Tuesday. The immediate effort by Mr. Bloomberg's advisers to limit the damage had been successful. And Mr. Bloomberg's decision to confront the problem head-on -- both on radio and in a telephone conversation with Mr. Dinkins -- clearly distinguished his approach from that of Mr. Green during the aftermath of the Democratic runoff with Mr. Ferrer.
"Mike said to us very often during the campaign: 'I must be able to look myself in the mirror. I have to be able to tell my daughters what I did that day without being embarrassed,' " Mr. Cunningham said. "He needed to know that his core values and reputation would be intact when this was over. He was not going to sacrifice 59 years of building a name and being honest and straightforward at the altar of politics in New York."
The staff had done its part. Mr. Bloomberg had done his. And then there was the luck.
This time it came from the Yankees. The brochure had to compete for attention with Game 7 of the World Series and the Yankees' heartbreaking loss in the bottom of the ninth inning. Most New Yorkers were talking Monday morning about the Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, not Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Cunningham said he was relieved when he picked up the newspapers on Monday morning and saw the Yankees everywhere.
"Luck plays a very big part in politics," he said.
There were other times when Mr. Bloomberg's road to City Hall was as bumpy -- and unconventional -- as it was unlikely.
After he officially announced his candidacy on June 5, the campaign survived a spate of verbal miscues by Mr. Bloomberg that alternately offended some police officers and firefighters, some Jews, some African Americans and some civil libertarians. 
Many of his comments, if taken in context or if expanded upon by Mr. Bloomberg in a different setting, were not nearly as outlandish as they first appeared. But the damage was done. Mastering the sound bite was one of the hardest lessons for Mr. Bloomberg.
"There were times when he was just dispirited by the press," said Jonathan T. Capehart, a campaign staff member who had been a journalist at The Daily News. "He would say: 'I just don't get it. Why are they doing this?' "
As he became a more experienced campaigner, Mr. Bloomberg made fewer off-the-cuff slip-ups. In the final month, a new speechwriter was added to the staff who seemed to have a better appreciation for his tone and mannerisms, making it more likely that Mr. Bloomberg would follow his texts. Nonetheless, Mr. Bloomberg continued to resist efforts by some handlers to make him more scripted and to stay on message.
"Mike didn't feel that he could be compelling if he was checking every word he said," said Mr. Skyler, who as Mr. Bloomberg's spokesman spent more time with him on the campaign trail than any other staff member. "He knew that if he wasn't compelling, he wouldn't be able to win people over. It was a chance that he took. And obviously he made the right choice."
At a breakfast speech to Crain's New York Business on Oct. 17, he surprised his own staff when he broke from the prepared text about economic development and proposed turning Governors Island into an educational center with high schools and college campuses. Though the idea had been bantered about before, it was never intended to be publicly disclosed that morning.
The suggestion became one of the most talked about parts of Mr. Bloomberg's speech -- and was ultimately turned against him by Mr. Green in campaign appearances and in one of their debates.
"Mike, for better or worse, spoke his mind," said Maureen Connelly, a former press secretary to Mayor Koch and a Bloomberg consultant. "Mike is someone who wants to try out ideas. He is an inventor. He was more involved than any other candidate I have worked for in the development of policy."
In another pivotal defeat for conventional wisdom, Mr. Bloomberg was able to turn his enormous personal wealth into a political asset, beyond just being able to buy more advertising than his opponents are. He made the case that his independence from special interests put him above reproach. He talked openly about his philanthropy and doing good with his money and humbly about the roots of his own success.
As the campaign progressed, public opinion polls began showing that most voters were not concerned about his money.
When the economy began to sour, even ahead of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the luck factor again came into play. The idea of a rich, self-made businessman with lots of connections to the private sector suddenly seemed more comforting than threatening. 
"He was always such a long shot, that when things started to turn, I remember turning to his daughter Emma, and saying, 'You know, your father can really win this,' " Ms. Connelly said. "She said, 'Yeah, I think so too.' "

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: INSIDE THE N.B.A.; 
A Dip in Attendance And a Rise in Angst

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Gary Payton tried to keep up with Jason Kidd on Thursday night in the Meadowlands, a hoop-junkie matchup between two Oakland playground legends acknowledged as the game's two elite point guards. The listed attendance was 5,277 -- for a building holding 20,049 seats.
 Tim Duncan, David Robinson and the San Antonio Spurs played the same night before 9,511 in Charlotte Coliseum, barely half full. 
 The Nets and the Hornets, whose attendance woes are hardly new, play in arenas with few amenities compared with some of the league's more modern facilities.
Also, during the season's first week, a riveting World Series competed with the N.B.A. for fans' time and attention. 
Yet even with those disclaimers, and based on very early returns, the league may experience more economic pain over the next few months.
Through Thursday night's games, the N.B.A. has seen a slight drop of 3.3 percent in average attendance, to 16,153 a game from 16,784 at the end of last season.
The Nets may be the most disturbing harbinger of all. They made a blockbuster trade for an All-Star -- Kidd for Stephon Marbury -- and signed a bona fide center in Todd MacCulloch to upgrade their roster. The Nets won four of their first five games to take the lead in the Atlantic Division.
Still, the Nets are last in attendance, averaging 6,547 fans; yesterday's game against Cleveland drew 5,631. The Nets finished 27th in attendance last season, averaging 13,807.
The drop in attendance comes even as the league posted its first decrease in the 11-year history of the Fan Cost Index, an annual independent survey by the Team Marketing Report that calculates the average cost for four people to attend a game.
The average ticket price in the N.B.A. is $50.10, down 2.3 percent from last season. The average cost of four to attend a game fell to $277.19, a decrease of 1.6 percent.
Although the figures are arrived at through several sources, league and team officials have long questioned the accuracy of the Team Marketing Report. They insist that average ticket prices and fan cost indexes obscure median prices and group packages offered by many teams that allow four people to spend less than $100 total a game.
The N.B.A. contends that ticket prices have actually risen, albeit modestly, this season.
Interestingly, Detroit is leading the league in attendance after two games, averaging 22,076 at the Palace at Auburn Hills. At $31.90, the Pistons' average ticket price dropped 20.3 percent from last year, Team Marketing Report said.
"This is about responding to the needs of our fans, our stakeholders," Tom Wilson, the president of Palace Sports and Entertainment, said. "People were making decisions not to come here, and the No. 1 reason was dollars."
Only two teams raised their ticket prices more than 10 percent, Team Marketing Report said. Average season ticket prices for the Dallas Mavericks jumped 55 percent, almost solely because of a new arena. At $58.27, the Mavericks have the league's sixth-highest average ticket price.
The Sacramento Kings are charging their fans 12.1 percent more than they did last season, mostly because of supply and demand in a one-team town.
For the fourth straight year, the Knicks topped the average ticket price category: $89.80, a decrease of 1.5 percent from last season. On average, it costs $460.70 for four people to see a Knicks game at Madison Square Garden. By comparison, it costs $198.20 for the same night out in Charlotte.
"Obviously it's very early in the season for any projections, but thus far we're very pleased with attendance," said Bernie Mullin, the league's senior vice president for marketing and team business operations. "When you look at all the after-effects of Sept. 11 in the hospitality and entertainment industries, we feel very fortunate right now."
Though he could not provide exact figures, Mullin added that season-ticket sales have actually increased. "Clearly what's going on is the average fan on the street has decided to stay home the first couple of weeks," he said. "That's what's contributing to the small decline. With everything that's happening in the world, we understand that."

Learning the Ropes
On the surface, Keon Clark's elbow to the head of Troy Murphy on Wednesday night was just another knucklehead, roughhouse play perpetrated by an impetuous young player. But the suspension that followed Clark's flagrant foul in the fourth quarter of the Warriors-Raptors game -- one game without pay and a $7,500 fine -- may have hinted at something else.
One of the plays not shown on television during the game was Jerome Williams's apparent swing at Murphy while he was on the ground after Clark elbowed him.
Murphy, the Notre Dame rookie taken in the first round of the draft by Golden State, was also involved in an altercation last Sunday against Portland. After Dale Davis and Murphy were assessed double technical fouls for tangling under the basket, Murphy dunked over Davis and briefly stared at him. He was assessed a technical for taunting and ejected from the game.
Murphy is averaging 7.8 points and 6.6 rebounds a game. He can shoot, drive and bang inside. Because he is one of those defenders who annoys -- fronting the post, swiping at the ball, basically acting like a gnat -- the consensus is that veterans are testing the rookie's resolve.
Preceding Clark's elbow in the Toronto game, Murphy drove past Clark twice, drew fouls and completed consecutive 3-point plays, prompting an irate Lenny Wilkens, Toronto's coach, to send Clark to the bench.
One veteran official said on condition of anonymity: "I don't know why, but a lot of players are going after this Murphy kid. I don't think it's because he's dirty or too physical. I think it's because he can play a little and he doesn't back down."

Hill Assesses Jordan
Grant Hill is like any other fan who enjoys watching Michael Jordan play. Hill just hopes Jordan eventually understands the importance of his position off the court.
"At some point, I'd like to see him succeed in the front office," Hill, the Orlando Magic forward, said in a recent interview. "He needs to understand at some point that he has to give it up, whether it's next year or the year after.
"There are so few of us in that position. And finally we have someone who has the resources not just to be in the front office but also to be an owner, calling the shots. I'd rather see him in that position than playing for the Wizards.
"He set the example, especially for African-American athletes. All athletes. He's opened doors with marketing. Now that you have guys making the kind of money we make and the kind of resources we have, it would be nice to see him stick it out in the front office."
Unlike many athlete-activists calling for Jordan to be more involved politically, Hill does not subscribe to the notion that Jordan needs to take on larger causes after his playing career is finished.
"I read something Bill Russell said in his book, that so many people compare Jordan to athletes of Russell's era, the Jim Browns, the Alis," Hill said. "And he said: 'Times are different. People have different realities.' What Bill Russell had to endure as a child growing up or as an athlete are not the same realities that Michael Jordan has had to endure. So because of that, don't get on Michael for not being like Bill. Times have changed."
As a player who doubted his own ability to play the game at a high level because of injuries the past two years, Hill, in a way, now empathizes with Jordan.
"My dad used to say athletes die twice," Hill said of his father, Calvin, the former Cowboys running back. "We die when we retire, and of course we naturally die. I'm just guessing he's prolonging that eventual death as a player.
"As a fan, I like watching Michael play. For me the excitement now may not be him winning games or be him dunking on people -- it won't be.
"But to see how classy he can be at his age, kind of showing you, like Larry Bird did, that you don't have to be a great athlete to dominate. I also think it will give people an appreciation for his fundamentals. Because physically, he's not where he was. Fundamentally, he is a Larry Bird. But I don't think he ever truly got credit for that."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: HEARTS AND MINDS 

BYLINE:  By SARAH SLOBIN

 BODY:
 A history of how the government has presented images of war and controlled information, and of how the message got out.
 SARAH SLOBIN

WORLD WAR I

SPEAKING AT SILENT MOVIES
In 1917 an army of 75,000 volunteers called the Four-Minute Men, like those at left, were recruited by George Creel, a journalist and advertising man. They made patriotic war speeches to audiences before the start of (silent) movies.

"Matters lying outside our own life as a nation and over which we had no control, but which, despite our wish to keep free of them, have drawn us more and more irresistibly into their own current and influence. It has been impossible to avoid them."
--President Woodrow Wilson

WORLD WAR II

MOVIE REELS AND MOVIE STARS
President Roosevelt touted Hollywood as an essential war industry. Movie stars and entertainers like the Andrews Sisters, right, collaborated on newsreels. Support was easy to generate as Pearl Harbor came on the heels of the Depression, and war brought with it not only hope for an economic bounce but clear-cut enemies to despise.

"Today we seek a moral basis for peace. . . . It cannot be a lasting peace if the fruit of it is oppression, or starvation, cruelty, or human life dominated by armed camps. It cannot be a sound peace if small nations must live in fear of powerful neighbors. It cannot be a moral peace if freedom from invasion is sold for tribute."
--President Franklin D. Roosevelt

THE KOREAN WAR

PSYCHOLOGY AND PUBLIC RELATIONS

The propaganda machine was in full swing, but its focus shifted toward the Korean people and American soldiers. Psychological warfare leaflets, like those being packed into a shell at left, were dropped in the hopes of inducing the North Koreans to surrender. General Douglas MacArthur, who censored news reports from the front lines, disagreed with the Truman administration's war policy and was later dismissed.

"It must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures."
--President Harry S. Truman

COLD WAR

NIXON IN THE KITCHEN

At a model of an American kitchen, an exhibit in Moscow to showcase capitalism, Vice President Richard M. Nixon and the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, fell into a much-publicized and heated debate.

"The cold war isn't thawing; it is burning with a deadly heat. Communism isn't sleeping; it is, as always, plotting, scheming, working, fighting."
--President Richard M. Nixon

VIETNAM WAR

SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL

While fear of spreading communism initially generated support for intervention in Vietnam, it was not enough to sustain it. The government had counted on television to promote its cause. Reporters were invited in to cover battle events. But when the television images began to include body bags and terrified children fleeing napalm attacks, popular support for the war eroded, and the media grew critical.

"Just like the Alamo, somebody damn well needed to go to their aid. Well, by God, I'm going to Vietnam's aid!"
--President Lyndon B. Johnson

GULF WAR

A 24-HOUR OPERATION
The lessons of Vietnam brought tight restraints on the release of information even as cable news speeded the rhythm of war news on display. General Colin L. Powell presented remote airwar targeting techniques, while the voice of soldiers was delivered via the White House.

"Listen to Master Sergeant J . P. Kendall of the 82nd Airborne: 'We're here for more than just the price of a gallon of gas. What we're doing is going to chart the future of the world for the next 100 years. It's better to deal with this guy now than 5 years from now."'
--President George Bush

HEADLINE: Voter Portraits: New York City 

BYLINE:  By MARJORIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
After a campaign marked by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and record-breaking campaign spending, Michael R. Bloomberg was elected the 108th mayor of New York City last week, defeating his Democratic opponent, Mark Green. Pre-election polls showed Mr. Green leading by about 15 percentage points until the week before Election Day. After Mayor Giuliani endorsed him, Mr. Bloomberg began to close the gap and the last polls before the election showed the candidates tied. 
 Mr. Bloomberg was elected with the support of the same groups that elected Mr. Giuliani: Republicans and independents, moderates and conservatives, Catholics, older voters and men. Unlike Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Bloomberg did well among Hispanic voters, particularly Hispanic men. Mr. Green's best showing was among blacks, Democrats, liberals and voters with low incomes. 
 This table, based on surveys of voters leaving polling stations in New York City, shows how different groups have voted for mayor since 1989. Because large numbers of people are surveyed, the polls can measure the preferences of groups whose proportion of the voting population is often too small to examine in a typical telephone survey.

Race, Ethnicity and Religion
Like Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Bloomberg received the support of most white voters. But Mr. Bloomberg did better than Mr. Giuliani among both black and Hispanic voters. Four years ago, when Mr. Giuliani easily defeated Ruth W. Messinger, 43 percent of Hispanic voters and 20 percent of black voters voted to re-elect the mayor. This year, the Republican candidate's share of the black vote rose to 25 percent. Hispanic voters divided their votes almost evenly between the Republican and the Democrat.
In addition, Hispanic voters made up a smaller percentage of voters who went to the polls this year, perhaps in reaction to the Democratic primary campaign in which Mr. Green defeated Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, after accusations that Mr. Green ran a harsh, racially divisive runoff campaign.
In the previous three elections, more than 60 percent of Catholics supported Mr. Giuliani. And Mr. Giuliani received the backing of most Jewish voters. This year, while about as many Catholics backed Mr. Bloomberg, the Jewish vote was more closely divided, with Mr. Green receiving the support of more than half of the Jewish voters.

Pocketbook Concerns
The higher a voter's income, the more likely he or she was to back Mr. Bloomberg. More than half of voters whose incomes were less than $50,000 supported Mr. Green, while voters with incomes of more than $75,000 preferred Mr. Bloomberg.
While it is not surprising that wealthier voters supported the Republican candidate, Mr. Bloomberg did much better than Mr. Giuliani with two groups that often back Democratic candidates. Unemployed workers strongly supported the Democratic candidate in 1997, but this year, Mr. Bloomberg received more than half of their votes. Four years ago, Ms. Messinger was backed by almost two-thirds of people whose financial situation had deteriorated since the previous mayoral election. This year, only about half supported Mr. Green, while Mr. Bloomberg received the votes of 40 percent. MARJORIE CONNELLY

 HIT TO KILL
The New Battle Over Shielding America
From Missile Attack.

THE UNFINISHED TWENTIETH CENTURY
By Jonathan Schell.

 THE case for a trillion-dollar missile defense system would seem to have collapsed on Sept. 11. In the time it took for suicide bombers to fly into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon, it seemed instantly clear that even the most sophisticated antimissile missile system would have been worthless against hijacked domestic passenger jets. Or pretending for a moment that a missile shield could be made to work -- at any cost -- how would it cope with anthrax? 
Questions of nuclear strategy would seem laughably passe now -- if they weren't so serious. But with nuclear-armed India and Pakistan very much in play, and Iran and Iraq engaged in their own arms race, readers who've been emptying bookstores in search of instant wisdom on low-tech terrorism and early Islam would be wise to pick up "Hit to Kill" and "The Unfinished Twentieth Century," thoughtful but very different books that, taken together, tell how we got into this nuclear mess and how we might get out of it. 
The single most important proponent of missile defenses, in any event, thinks the case for perfecting rockets to knock out incoming missiles is still strong. "Envision a world in which a terrorist thug and/or a host nation might have the ability to develop -- to deliver a weapon of mass destruction via rocket," President Bush urged last month. "At the very least it should be in our nation's advantage to determine whether we can shoot it down." 
"Whether," of course, is still the big question, as Bradley Graham ably shows in "Hit to Kill." No one said it would be easy, but after the billions of dollars spent since 1962 trying to hit a bullet with a bullet, critics have earned the right to raise questions. Missile defense, of course, is not just rocket science, as Graham, a tenacious military and foreign affairs reporter for The Washington Post, recounts with resolute evenhandedness; it has far-reaching military, diplomatic and economic ripples as well. But what's astonishing in his tale is how much the quest for a missile shield remains, as Bill Clinton put it, "a matter of theology, not evidence" for its mostly Republican proponents. 
Graham aptly starts his story where many disciples first get Star Wars religion, in the darkened command center of the North American Aerospace Defense complex inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colo. On a global radar screen, visiting officials get to see a glowing dot rising in the Far East -- a simulated North Korean missile launch. As the warhead floats toward the United States, most people naturally ask how it'll be stopped. When they learn there's no way, they leave shaken. That was the show that hooked the presidential candidate Ronald Reagan in 1980. George W. Bush got the fever from Reagan back then, he told Graham in an interview last summer. "I don't think I'd really focused on missile defense until Ronald Reagan brought up Star Wars." 
Graham pushes the story through seemingly every study, commission and political fight from the mid-1980's through the Clinton administration, which had about as much enthusiasm for missile defense as it did welfare reform. In the end, Clinton kept the program alive because he calculated that letting it die would be politically dangerous, which is saying a lot for a $60 billion idea. 
Graham finds some lovable rogues to blow needed air into his story, like Gen. Larry Welch of the Air Force, a missile proponent who battled political pressures that created a "rush to failure" in the tests, and Donald Rumsfeld, now secretary of defense, who served as chairman of a hardheaded 1995 commission that destroyed the C.I.A.'s mushy reports on enemy missile threats. Then there are the missile scientists themselves, who often seem only grown-up versions of the rocket-shooting boys in the movie "October Sky." It's easy to feel their pain when yet another test goes awry.
But Graham gives too little voice to crusty skeptics like Gen. Charles Krulak of the Marines and Gen. Hugh Shelton of the Army, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who winced at the billions thrown at Star Wars at the expense of better equipping and training ordinary troops. "Do you really think North Korea would send a missile?" Krulak barks. "We'd vaporize them. They would never get a missile off." How refreshing: a hawk's argument for missile-defense doves. 
But even if a shield were perfected -- a subject that is part of the backdrop to the three-day meeting between Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia scheduled for this week -- Moscow and Washington may well cling to just enough missiles to guarantee "mutually assured destruction," which could destroy all life itself. 
That prospect chills Jonathan Schell, who became sort of a poet laureate of the nuclear freeze movement in the late 1970's and 80's, offering eloquent arguments about the psychology of weapons and the inevitablity of their use when they are in hand, whether in a Vietnamese hamlet or a high-tech bunker in Cheyenne Mountain. Terror "became the lingua franca of 20th-century politics," he writes, from poison gas in the trenches of 1914-18 to the wholesale bombing of cities in World War II to nuclear doctrine now.
It wasn't supposed to be this way after the giddy days of Gorbachev and Reagan, when the whiff of disarmament was in the air. But, Schell writes, the "startling fact is that nuclear arms control is faring worse in a world without the Soviet Union than it did in the last days of the cold war." 
In the context of current events, "Hit to Kill" already seems like distant history, a maddening chronicle of Washington fiddling while South Asia burns. One need not entirely agree with Schell that "if in the early 1990's the existing nuclear powers had committed themselves to the elimination of nuclear weapons and had by 1998 traveled some of the distance to that goal, it is hard to believe that South Asia would be engaged in a nuclear arms race today." But his somber plea for the major nuclear powers to adopt an abolitionist agenda before the minor nuclear players do us all in, written well before Sept. 11 shattered our false sense of security, comes freighted with a poignant urgency.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
A Deficit Ahead, Many Forks In the Road

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
LAST spring, when Congress was debating President Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut, many Democrats warned that the amount was too big, that the reduction left no buffer for unexpected bad news and would ultimately lead to spending cuts.
 In many ways, they have already been proved right. 
 Even before Sept. 11, it was clear that the tax cut and the economic slowdown had eaten away much of the projected budget surplus. Since the terrorist attacks, it has become nearly certain that the federal government will lapse into a deficit for at least a year or longer. While the administration is pushing hard for another round of tax cuts to revive the economy, it is also drawing up plans to squeeze spending on domestic and social programs in next year's budget and has threatened to veto any additional spending passed by Congress this year. 
The situation helps to explain the bitterness of the partisan debate over the proposed economic stimulus package.
Feeling that they were rolled once by Mr. Bush on taxes this year, Democrats seem determined this time around to ensure that any stimulus plan reflects their priorities.
"It seems that many in the Senate Democratic caucus want some kind of payback against the bipartisan tax relief legislation," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. "In their view, the bipartisan deal was wrong, and with their caucus now running the Senate, they do not want to see it repeated in any way."
But Republicans, having once succeeded in pushing through a big tax cut against the odds, are equally determined to go to the well a second time. And they remain convinced that they can get most of what they want even though the Democrats took control of the Senate soon after Congress passed the Bush tax cut in May.
The immediate consequence of the standoff has been to make Congress and the White House appear more interested in scoring ideological and political points than in preserving jobs and helping people who are suffering in the early stages of what seems sure to be a recession. The slow pace of their effort to help the economy stands in contrast to the Federal Reserve's rapid-fire series of interest rate cuts.
But it also raises long-term questions for both parties. 
Can Republicans credibly maintain, as they have for years now, that tax cuts are the solution to every economic problem? 
And can Democrats stick with the economic policy framework they adopted during the Clinton administration -- a somewhat uncomfortable marriage of fiscal responsibility and continued belief in activist government -- when the basis of that policy, the budget surplus, may be disappearing?
Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, surveyed voters recently about the economic stimulus plans put forth by the two parties. Nearly every major idea from both sides of the aisle got strong support. 
Cutting the capital gains tax, a Republican proposal, was favored by 70 percent of those surveyed. Providing more federal money for building projects, a staple of Democratic fiscal policy, was backed by 85 percent. A Democratic plan to subsidize at least half of health insurance premiums for the unemployed won 68 percent support.
Of the proposals still under serious consideration in Congress, only one polled badly: the Republican plan to repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax and allow some of the nation's largest corporations to claim immediate refunds totaling billions of dollars from past liabilities under the tax. That proposal got just 28 percent support.
Both parties say they are more interested in doing the right thing for the economy than in scoring political points.
There is clearly room for compromise. Privately, members of both parties suggest that they could live with a package that includes immediate and permanent income tax rate cuts in the low- and middle-income brackets, investment incentives for business, more money to help the unemployed and one-time rebates for people who did not qualify for the first round this summer.
But their approaches so far could not be more starkly different. The Republican bill passed by the House focuses on tax cuts for business. The Democratic bill under consideration in the Senate directs money primarily to the unemployed and to new spending programs.
That gulf creates a situation in which both parties are sorely tempted to dwell on their differences. By doing so, they can energize their political bases and reap material for campaign commercials a year ahead of a midterm election in which control of both the House and the Senate is up for grabs.
The question is whether they indulge that temptation for so long that they render themselves irrelevant to the economy.

Consumers Ready To Spend for Holidays

BYLINE:  Compiled by Vivian Marino 

 BODY:
Perhaps people are following President Bush's suggestion that they go on with their lives in a normal way, or maybe they are just plain sentimental about the holidays.
 Whatever the reasons, a survey released last week says that the majority of households have no plans to curtail holiday spending this year despite the bruised economy and the terrorist attacks. 
 Fifty-seven percent of the 1,019 people questioned nationwide in late October said they would spend about the same amount as last year, while 28 percent planned to spend less and 18 percent more. 
"The contraction in holiday spending may not be as pronounced as we might have expected," said Bill Hampel, chief economist for the Credit Union National Association, which conducted the survey with the Consumer Federation of America.
With that said, consumers should still be careful not to overspend, especially if they plan to do most of their buying on credit. Here are some suggestions:
* Draft a budget and stick to it. Start by listing proposed expenditures for gifts, food, decorations and travel, then tally up the totals from each category. If the figure seems high, make some trims.
* Set aside money. Although it would have been ideal to have started an account a year ago, there is still time. 
* Reduce interest payments. If you are buying on credit, look for credit cards with the lowest interest rates; with rates declining, now is a good time to find them.
* Shop wisely. Make an effort to comparison shop and to avoid buying on impulse or shopping when rushed.

HEADLINE: A Nation Challenged 

 BODY:
 The Enemy and the Ally

PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS -- President Bush tried to cast the war against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in the broadest global context as he told the United Nations that every member country was a potential target of terrorism and that the responsibility for fighting to stop it was "binding on every nation with a place in this chamber." Mr. Bush's speech, his first to the General Assembly, opened two days of intense diplomacy to enlist more support for his war against terrorism. A1

DEFINING TERRORISM -- A reflection of the degree to which Sept. 11 now dominates the agenda of international affairs was displayed at probably the most focused General Assembly session in years. It got under way with a lecture from President Bush on the evil of terror, followed by a procession of world leaders seeking to distinguish between terrorists and freedom fighters. B2

Progress on the Ground

REBELS ADVANCE -- Fresh from their victory in Mazar-i-Sharif, Northern Alliance troops attacked Taliban positions across a broad front in the far northeast of Afghanistan, consolidating their gains and claiming to have secured a string of provincial capitals from the retreating Taliban forces. Moving forward under a deafening barrage of artillery fire and American bombs, the offensive appeared aimed at catching the retreating Taliban forces in a pair of vices, one in the east of the country and the other in the west. A1

CHEMICAL WEAPONS -- The United States has identified sites in Afghanistan that are suspected of being involved in Osama bin Laden's efforts to acquire and produce chemical and biological weapons, but none have been bombed since the military campaign began. Administration officials refused to say why the sites have not been bombed. B1

DIVISIONS EMERGING -- As Northern Alliance commanders relish their success in seizing Mazar-i-Sharif and prepare to mount an offensive against the capital, Kabul, signs of division are emerging in the group's political leadership. B3

NEWS ANALYSIS -- The first victory for the Northern Alliance at Mazar-i-Sharif after a month of fighting brings both opportunity and potential risk for the Bush administration in Afghanistan. The first order of business, according to experts, should be to demonstrate that the Northern Alliance will not be allowed to plunder the city. B3

Hearts and Minds

DAMAGE CONTROL -- Matching old-fashioned patriotism to the frantic pace of modern communications, the Bush administration is trying to persuade audiences here and abroad to support the war. The highly orchestrated efforts are meant to counter the propaganda of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden while keeping tight control on the flow of news about how the war is being waged. A1

THE ARAB MEDIA -- The main message delivered by most Arab newspapers and television has been that the United States has moved arrogantly, blindly, even callously into conflict in a country that it does not understand, and that the consequences could be worse than if the Americans had left well enough alone. B5

THE MESSAGE MAKERS -- Four women -- Karen P. Hughes, the White House communications director; Victoria Clarke, chief Pentagon spokeswoman; Charlotte Beers, under secretary of state for public diplomacy; and Mary Matalin, chief political adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney -- are among the administration's most important shapers of the words and images that the allies are seeking to convey to a global audience. B6

HOLLYWOOD'S ROLE -- Several dozen top Hollywood executives are to meet with Karl Rove, President Bush's senior adviser, this morning to discuss how the entertainment industry can contribute to the war effort. They confront a different world than Hollywood and Washington faced in the opening months of World War II. B6

PUBLIC OPINION -- In dozens of interviews across the country, Americans said they generally were satisfied with the amount of information being disseminated by the government about the combat in Afghanistan and the war on bioterrorism at home. B6

Assessing the Damages

BIOTERROR PROGRAM -- Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started a bioterrorism initiative two years ago, nearly a dozen experts, including current and former government officials, said that the program was not given a high enough priority. A1

PAIN AND SUFFERING -- Hundreds of lawyers are beginning to calculate the potential value of cases of those who lost their loved ones in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. In addition to damages for economic losses, intangible things, like the suffering before an inescapable death, are given a price tag. Lawyers say they are struggling to analyze how such intangibles should be computed. B1

Autopsy of the Towers

WHY THEY FELL -- Engineers think they are closing in on the specific structural failures that set off the deadly sequence of events that ended in the collapse of the trade center towers. B1

Life in Wartime

U.S.-CANADIAN BORDER -- Point Roberts, Wash., is perhaps the most isolated community in the United States outside Alaska. Since Sept. 11, residents there have felt even more cut off, as border crossings that used to take about 35 minutes now take up to half a day because of tightened security. B7

INNOCENT VICTIMS -- Egyptian newcomers in Evansville, Ind., learned a startling lesson about this country last month when four Islamic restaurant workers and five Islamic friends were taken off in chains and held for a week without being charged with anything. B7

WELCOME HOME -- Nearly 10,000 people in Norfolk, Va., cheered and waved patriotic banners as one of the first aircraft carriers to strike at Afghanistan, the Enterprise, returned to her home port. B7

HEADLINE: A Shaky Economy May Threaten Future Giving 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
IN the four weeks after Sept. 11, more than half of American adults gave money to disaster relief efforts, and 7 in 10 donated money, blood or time, according to a survey released by the Independent Sector, a Washington nonprofit group dedicated to strengthening the efforts of other nonprofit groups.
 The outpouring of contributions, which totaled more than $1 billion, brought in many new donors: more than a quarter of those who donated money after the terrorist attacks had never contributed to a disaster relief effort before. 
 While many charities nationwide have experienced sharp drops in contributions since the attacks -- and almost all have worried that the faltering economy would diminish year-end fund-raising -- the survey offered some reassurances about future giving. Almost three-quarters of those who donated money to the relief effort said they expected to give as much as or more than usual this year to other charities. But others expressed concern about that finding. 
"Usually, a hundred percent will say they're planning to continue giving," said Jack Shakely, the president of the California Community Foundation in Los Angeles. "If a quarter are admitting that they're not going to give as much, that's a very soft underbelly to worry about."
The worsening economy is a serious threat to charity. Almost half of those polled said they would reduce their charitable giving in the next six months if the economic slowdown worsens, and 1 in 10 said they would completely stop their giving. 
Financial contributions were the most common donation toward the relief efforts. Nationwide, 58 percent of those surveyed donated money, with those age 35 to 54 being the most active donors. Support was strongest in New England, where more than three-quarters of those surveyed sent in money. 
The survey found that 13 percent of Americans donated blood, with those under 35 the most likely to make such donations. Overall, the survey found, 11 percent of Americans contributed their time, and African-Americans were almost twice as likely as whites to give as such. 
The telephone poll of a representative sample of 1,009 American adults was conducted Oct. 5 to 8 by Wirthlin Worldwide, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Benefits Are Toned Down, or Called Off

BYLINE:  By SHELBY WHITE 

 BODY:
NOT surprisingly, this fall's benefit season in New York has been unlike any other in recent memory. The shock of the World Trade Center attack, coupled with the troubled economy, affected almost every event scheduled for September or October. Some were canceled outright; others postponed. Almost every one that went on was toned down.
 A few examples: The Animal Medical Center, with almost $1 million in advance ticket sales, called off its Top Dog Gala Dinner Dance scheduled for Sept. 19 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Although ticket holders had the option of asking for their money back, only four donors requested it. 
 At the New York Philharmonic's opening night on Sept. 20, the cocktail hour and dinner were canceled. Instead, the orchestra gave a memorial performance of Brahms's "German Requiem." At the conclusion, the members of the audience were asked to remain silent.
The Actors' Fund of America Gala, scheduled for tonight, has been moved to April 29. James Nederlander, the honoree, said he was uncomfortable having a fund-raiser so soon after the attacks. The postponement came at a time when the organization, which provides social services to workers in the entertainment industry, was facing a $1 million increase in demand for its services as many Broadway shows were closing. Joe Benincasa, the executive director of the Actors' Fund of America, estimated the loss at $600,000. 
Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts also canceled its fall benefit, which was to be a concert by the Philharmonia Orchestra of London. It plans to go ahead with its spring gala in April, but Daisy Soros, who has been the spring benefit co-chairwoman for the last eight years, said "the evening will be scaled down, less la de da, less flowers."
"It's not in good taste," she said. "You have to use judgment."
Canceling or postponing an event means more than simply losing a party. The nonprofit organization risks a loss of revenue that is often a major part of its annual budget. In addition, deposits have been made to hotels and caterers who, along with other services, also lose business. More than 100 benefits, large and small, were listed in New York Masterplanner, a monthly guide to the forthcoming year of events in the city, for just the first two weeks in October.
Susan Burden, a family therapist and the treasurer of New Yorkers for Children, a nonprofit group that supplements the city's child welfare services, said the organization debated whether to cancel or postpone its dinner on Sept. 19 at Cipriani 42nd Street. Yet after speaking with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the event's honorary chairman, the organizers decided to go ahead with it. The evening, Ms. Burden said, served a much-needed purpose.
"Although we complain about them and we struggle to find other ways to raise needed support," she said, "in the end we keep coming back to benefits to raise private funds for organizations."
The event raised $800,000 for the charity, and was attended by about 700 people, including the mayor, who arrived after dinner with the fire commissioner.
WHILE organizers of events that did go on worried that people would stay home, New Yorkers proved remarkably resilient, turning out in significant numbers. And benefits may have had a healing effect. "When people go to events they are glad that they went through with it," said Dr. Hadassah Brooks Morgan, a New York City psychiatrist. "The respite gives them the sustenance to go on." 
Still, anxieties remain. Jim Kirsch of Abigail Kirsch Culinary Productions, a caterer based in Tarrytown, N.Y., said that many groups were still uncertain just how to proceed. "People are holding dates, but they are having trouble lining up honorees," he said. "Many people are unwilling to make a commitment too far in advance."
Daisy Soros is concerned about the prospects for Lincoln Center's spring gala, which usually brings in $2 million. "We don't know whether we can set our goal so high," she said. "Everything is very iffy."

HEADLINE: After the Day When Time Stopped, How One Cause Went Forward 

BYLINE:  By JUDITH WARNER 

 BODY:
A CELEBRATORY spirit pervaded the Vanderbilt Room of the Roosevelt Hotel on the evening of Sept. 10. Many of the volunteers and staff members of the New York City affiliate of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation had been working night and day since mid-August to organize Race for the Cure, the annual event they hoped would raise $1.5 million for the foundation. 
 As the final details were nailed into place, the organizers congratulated themselves on a job well done. Everything was ready for the more than 30,000 walkers and runners who were to stream through Central Park that Sunday. The permits were in place, 32,000 T-shirts were folded and the Parks Department was on the alert. 
 Back at the Komen Foundation, near Times Square, 185 pink flags lay wrapped in plastic, ready to be unfurled around the skating rink at Rockefeller Center in the annual effort to color the city pink in honor of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the annual series of charity and awareness-raising events that would kick off two weeks after the race. 
The organization had come far in making the breast cancer cause visible in New York. "We'd been working round the clock and we were just getting to the reward," said George Ann Garrison, 67, a breast cancer survivor and volunteer.
But then Sept. 11 came, ushering in the tragedies that consumed the city's public resources for weeks to follow. Laraine Mancuso, the volunteer president of the Komen Foundation's New York affiliate, had to make a hard decision: what should be done about the race? 
Every year, the Komen Foundation, the largest breast cancer organization in the United States, holds dozens of races nationwide to raise money for breast cancer research. The fall races are some of the most popular activities in and around National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which since 1985 has become a crucial fund-raising and educational event. Last year, the New York race raised $1.3 million. Thousands of survivors of breast cancer attend it each year. Some measure their years free of cancer by the number of times they cross the finish line.
"I thought there had to be a way we could go forward,"' Ms. Mancuso said. "I was caught -- knowing our community was basically down on one knee and not wanting to do anything to make it shakier than it was. I kept asking myself: how to do the right thing?"
That question plagued the consortium of breast cancer groups that sponsor Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
"We all trod very carefully," said Elizabeth Woolfe, a spokeswoman for the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations. "We didn't want to feel we were shoving anything down anyone's throat or grabbing the spotlight."
In the days immediately after Sept. 11, the 17 organizations involved in planning the awareness month delayed press releases, questioned the wisdom of holding large outdoor events, reviewed concert plans and canceled a handful of races. 
In New York, the Komen affiliate struggled to find a way to carry on and hold the race, before finally deciding it had to be canceled, because the anticipated crowd would have overwhelmed police and Parks Department resources. The group would have to swallow the financial loss.
"All of us questioned what we were doing in the face of the tragedy of losing 5,000 people," said Susan Nathanson, the national coordinator of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. "But then we realized we lose 40,000 people to breast cancer each year, and we had to get back to what we were doing. We had to move forward even though we didn't have much hope of getting people to focus on us."
Everyone expected the worst for October. Even before Sept. 11, fund-raising goals had been lowered in response to the slowing economy. The Komen Foundation, which had annual donation increases of 15 to 30 percent over the last five years, expected that its 2000 donations of $131 million would hold in 2001. Other groups, however, readied themselves for steep declines. "We had very low expectations," Ms. Woolfe said. 
Yet, as October played out, the fund-raising disaster did not happen. On the contrary: as the calls for a return to "normalcy" grew, supporters of the cause rallied. With the nation still reeling, Laura Bush came through with a public service announcement for Lifetime Television. Even with anthrax dominating headlines, the "Today" show broadcast a five-part series on breast cancer the week of Oct. 22. While the races scheduled for New York, Chicago and Virginia Beach were canceled, 53 others went ahead, with participation even higher than last year and many runners and walkers carrying American flags. 
All the celebrities scheduled to fly into Los Angeles to tape Lifetime Television's "Women Rock!" benefit concert showed up. Despite its losses from Sept. 11, American Airlines went ahead with a celebrity benefit golf tournament the first weekend in October. And American Express, whose headquarters were one block west of the World Trade Center, carried on with its Charge for the Cure drive. Despite stock market turmoil, Gerard, Klauer, Mattison, an investment bank, rescheduled its Trade for the Cure Program, donating net commissions from institutional trading to Komen.
Some smaller breast cancer groups say they have been hit hard by the diversion of funds to disaster-related charities. Susan Braun, the president and chief executive of the Komen Foundation, thinks there will be a "short-term loss" in fund-raising this fall. But she also predicts that by year's end her group may actually be ahead of last year's levels. "The giving spirit Americans are so famous for has been rekindled in many people," she said.

HEADLINE: FUNDING; 
At Differing Speeds, Foundations Adjust to a World Transformed

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
FOUNDATIONS are used to acting with deliberation, not dispatch. But that, along with just about everything else, changed after Sept. 11. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, they showed uncharacteristic speed in pledging millions for disaster relief.
 The Council on Foundations, based in Washington, estimates that by mid-October, its 2,000-plus members had put up more than $278 million for disaster relief. They did this despite the fact that the value of their assets had plummeted with the stock market. Indeed, most had planned to rein in their grant-making this year. Foundations also picked up the slack in some crucial but hard-to-sell areas of the relief effort, like administrative costs and overhead. 
 But where longer-term grant-making is concerned, most foundations are still moving slowly, stepping cautiously in this newly transformed world. "It will take time for this to translate into programs," said Susan V. Berresford, the president of the Ford Foundation. In the weeks after Sept. 11, Ms. Berresford helped coordinate discussions, conference calls and e-mail exchanges among foundation leaders about their responses to the attacks. 
Ms. Berresford said that Ford, like many foundations, had allocated money immediately after the disaster, including $5 million for victim relief and administrative costs incurred by the relief funds. Ford plans to take up the question of longer-term program changes in the weeks and months to come, Ms. Berresford said.
The MacArthur Foundation, based in Chicago, also approved $5 million in grants soon after Sept. 11, though the grants were of a different nature. They included $250,000 to Human Rights Watch to pay for observers to interview refugees fleeing Afghanistan about human rights and to monitor threats to civil rights in the United States.
"If you were going to try to eliminate difficulties with the antiterrorist legislation when it was enacted, it couldn't wait until January or March," said Jonathan F. Fanton, the foundation's president. "Or if you were going to put observers on Afghanistan's borders to talk to refugees about human rights violations, you had to move quickly."
Although most foundations were moving less urgently, many began to re-examine their giving, usually starting by talking with existing grant recipients. David C. Speedie, the chairman of the Carnegie Corporation's international peace and security program, said the corporation already financed many programs in areas closely related to the events of Sept. 11, including research on biological weapons, nuclear weapons studies and emerging security threats. He said that grant recipients had the option of refocusing their work. 
"Some of our grantees are pretty imaginative people," Mr. Speedie said.
Some primary themes are emerging from the responses of foundations to Sept. 11, including how to combat the conditions that foster the growth of terrorism; how to increase understanding among Americans about the nature of the problems in third-world countries and the threats they may pose; and how to deal with some of the possible aftereffects of the attacks in America, including problems with civil liberties, immigration policies, interethnic relations, the economy and philanthropy.
Foundations always try to leave room for new initiatives. Considering the state of the economy and the stock portfolios of most foundations, however, many organizations will have to do some juggling to make room for such spending. 
Gordon Conway, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, whose endowment is about $3 billion, said that he expected this year's spending to be down at least 5 percent to 10 percent. (Last year, the foundation spent about $190 million.)
Yet despite the declines in their assets, many foundations said they were determined to allocate funds for projects related to Sept. 11. The MacArthur Foundation, whose assets shrank to $3.8 billion from a high of $4.5 billion, took the $5 million it used for its attack-related grants from its $30 million reserve fund.
Of all the problems that foundations seek to solve, perhaps the most overwhelming, financially and otherwise, is the struggle against poverty and other conditions that seem to foster terrorism.
"Even though the terrorists themselves may be middle class and Osama bin Laden may be rich, they get their enormous support from people in poverty," Mr. Conway said. He said his organization planned to continue its efforts to alleviate poverty and hunger and to provide health care around the world -- not just around Afghanistan and the Middle East but in Africa and elsewhere.
"We are continuing with what we were doing before Sept. 11, but intensifying it," Mr. Conway said.
Ms. Berresford said it was not just poverty that produced terrorists but also the lack of democratic traditions in some cultures, which limits the flow of information and thwarts any sort of evolution. She predicted that foundations working overseas would try to do more "to build open, democratic systems and to cultivate more open media systems around the world."
Closer to home, many foundation officials expressed concerns that despite the huge sums contributed for victim relief, there would be gaps in the victim relief safety net. Some provided money to help people like illegal immigrants or those who speak poor English who they believed were most likely to be left out.
The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a foundation affiliated with the Rockefeller family, is talking with immigrant community groups and legal aid organizations to identify needs but had not made specific grants as of early November. The Rockefeller Foundation gave $500,000 to the New York Foundation, a private organization that focuses on the city's neighborhoods, to distribute to community organizations helping immigrants.
There are also concerns that as the United States strengthens its antiterrorist programs, civil rights and immigration protections might be compromised. "We want to make sure we don't sacrifice what is unique about this country in trying to protect it," said Lance E. Lindblom, the president of the Nathan Cummings Foundation in New York, which allocated $500,000 for projects focusing on national security, civil liberties and tolerance after the attacks. 
ONE grant approved by the foundation was $100,000 to the National Security Archive Fund, based in Washington, for research into restrictions on public access to information for national security purposes, and for a public education campaign to increase the awareness of policy makers and the public on how to achieve security while respecting civil liberties and constitutional processes.
Some foundations are eager to educate the American public about issues related to the attacks. The MacArthur Foundation, in addition to supporting public radio, which has incurred larger-than-normal expenses in covering the war against terrorism, provided financing for a "Frontline" series on public television on topics like the origins of terrorism and Pakistani fundamentalism. The foundation also plans to make grants to groups that work with Islamic communities in the United States.
"There's a thirst for information on that part of the world," said Mr. Fanton, MacArthur's president.
Interethnic relations and training for psychological counseling are the focus of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which allocated $250,000 for grants after Sept. 11, including several to organizations it had worked with through its refugee studies program. Among these were grants to the International Rescue Committee for work on interethnic harmony and to Mercy Corps International for a study of trauma counseling programs in the New York area.
Many foundations said that in the post-attack world, they would also try to protect existing grantees who were less directly affected. Madeline Lee, the executive director of the New York Foundation, said that groups supported by her foundation feared cutbacks in support from both New York State, with its bare-bones budget, and from traditional donors who were directing their money to victim aid.
"An organization that works with Haitian women refugees said, 'Who's going to care about us now?' " Ms. Lee said. "You don't just stop what you are doing."

HEADLINE: Twilight of the Expos 

BYLINE:  By Paul E. Greenberg; Paul E. Greenberg is an economist.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Perhaps it will require the intervention of 28 baseball team owners to confirm what many have long thought: Major league baseball in Montreal was never meant to be. 
 Growing up in Montreal, I listened to my mother talk about going with her father, in the 1940's, to Montreal Royals games at Delormier Stadium. Those were glorious times for minor league baseball, and Montreal was the jewel in the rich farm system of the Brooklyn Dodgers. This was the era when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier, not in New York in 1947, but in Montreal one year earlier. Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe, Tommy Lasorda and Roberto Clemente also played with the Montreal Royals. 
 Then, in the 1960's, just as the Royals and minor league baseball were fading from Montrealers' memories, we got our Parisian-style metro system and played host to Canada's 100th birthday, Expo '67. This extravaganza became the namesake for the Montreal Expos, a franchise that was created on May 27, 1968, for the astronomical price of $10 million. 
During those first years in Jarry Park in the 70's, fans took to the team, though it was rarely a winner, and in the early '80's attendance at Expos games peaked. In 1981 the team made it to the playoffs, and in 1982 the city was host of the all-star game. That game -- which was held at Olympic Stadium, known affectionately as "the Big O," appropriately as "the Big Owe" and in my neighborhood as "the Big Oy!" -- was our proudest moment. With four Expos in the starting lineup -- Steve Rogers, Gary Carter, Andre Dawson and Tim Raines -- it seemed the team had finally made it. 
But since 1983, fan interest has fallen precipitously. Much has been said about the Expos being the Triple-A team for the rest of Major League Baseball, supplying stars like Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, Larry Walker and Moises Alou to other teams. The truth is that Montreal is not a small city but it is a small market for this sport, and the economics of baseball doomed this once glorious franchise to its current fate. It didn't help that that in the past 25 years there was a huge outflow of the English-speaking minority that was once its fan base.
But major league baseball in Montreal was never a perfect fit. At the outset, an entire French-language translation needed to be created to describe basic baseball terminology: voltigeur (outfielder), lanceur (pitcher), receveur (catcher), arret-court (shortstop) and assorted other baseball lingo that didn't make much sense in French. Baseball did the best it could in a country constantly in search of its identity.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation once ran a contest to complete the phrase "as Canadian as --." If this kind of question were posed for Americans, the immediate and assertive reply would be "apple pie." But the winning entrant in Canada was "as Canadian as possible under the circumstances." 
I have always found comfort from the fact that separations don't come easily in Canada. The discussion in the Province of Quebec over breaking away from the rest of the country predates the Expos. Despite this long debate, a final decision is still nowhere in sight. Somehow, I always thought the Expos would linger in an ambivalent status for many more years, too.

HEADLINE: SPREADING THE WEALTH; 
In Silicon Hills, Making Good On Vows of High-Tech Profits

BYLINE:  By COURTNEY BARRY 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
DURING the 1990's, Austin's new high-tech millionaires, marching lock step with the city's largely Birkenstock ethos, promised to help their community realize many goals -- a new performing arts center, a new art museum, more money for the local United Way. 
 Now, one steep Nasdaq slide later, the wallets of high-tech philanthropists here are noticeably thinner, and in some cases, empty. But while the fortunes of these executives have dissipated, their overall generosity has not -- not yet, at least. 
 In fact, Austin has only recently become acquainted with enormous wealth. "Traditionally, Austin was a salary town," says Paul Burka, the executive editor of Texas Monthly, who has lived here for 30 years. "There was very little money here. Most of the jobs were either in state government or at the University of Texas. If you look at where the decade of the 80's ended, it had no museum, no permanent collection. There wasn't much here in the way of a philanthropic base." 
"Probably the biggest cultural institution in town in the 70's was the Armadillo World Headquarters," Mr. Burka said, referring to a bare-bones National Guard armory that served as a music hall and was torn down in 1981 for high-technology development. The digital revolution transformed the simple, unpretentious city into Silicon Hills, thanks to new suburbs and the five-county surrounding region doubling in population to about 1.25 million. Austin boomed, thanks to the Dell Computer Corporation, which produced Dellionaires -- workers who became rich from stock options.
Other companies, like the Vignette Corporation, which sells software for Internet commerce, also helped spread the wealth.
From 1995 to 2000, Austin added 17,000 millionaires. In 1999, Austin companies generated about $18 billion in stock option wealth alone, according to AngelouEconomics, an economic development consulting firm in Austin. 
"High tech just changed everything," Mr. Burka said. "You had real money, real giving."
At first, many people in Austin were worried that those with new wealth would not give to the community. But in 1997, Michael and Susan Dell personally gave $1 million to the Austin Children's Museum. Since then, the Dellionaires and other entrepreneurs have elevated philanthropy to a new level -- and much of the donated money has flowed straight into Austin.
Austin's philanthropic boom almost matched the levels of the high-tech boom. The new philanthropists started about 80 foundations in Austin, said George Kozmetsky, the executive associate for economic affairs at the University of Texas System. "We started giving back while we were still making it," he said.
The question is whether the economic downturn will affect future giving. Austin's once vaunted $18 billion in stock option wealth hovers around $10.3 billion, according to AngelouEconomics.
At Dell, executive wealth -- which is based on the number of stock shares that are owned by company executives -- tumbled in mid-October to $8.4 billion from about $14.6 billion in 1999.
Vignette's executive wealth fell to $69 million last month from $1.3 billion in 1999. Other companies, like Living.com and Handtech.com, are simply no longer around. 
Even with the severe economic slowdown, giving has continued, but not at its former robust pace. Both the corporate and the family foundations set up by Michael and Susan Dell plan to continue the same rate of giving, even as the stock price of Dell has plunged. The Dell Foundation, the corporate giving arm that primarily supports groups and programs that benefit children in central Texas and central Tennessee, expects to hand out at least $5 million this year.
The Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which is the personal giving arm, plans to maintain its yearly $5 million in donations, as well as $20 million in future commitments. Just last February, the foundation announced a $10 million donation to the Long Center for the Performing Arts in Austin. This gift followed major contributions to the center by other top Dell executives, totaling $15 million in bequests. 
AFTER the Sept. 11 attacks, the family foundation announced a $1 million "challenge fund" to Dell employees for the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund. As of mid-October, contributions from employees topped $1.1 million, which Mr. Dell announced the family foundation would match. 
Despite its steep stock dive, Vignette gave the local United Way $600,000 in 2000 and was named as the top first-time giver that year. This year, Vignette's chief executive, Greg Peters, and his wife, Tess, gave $1.5 million of their own money to the Trinity Episcopal School.
In Austin, the United Way reported a mild drop in corporate giving this year. It expects to meet its $20.5 million goal, which is slightly higher than last year's amount.
"We've seen increases to some gifts," said Marlene Rich, the director of major gifts for the United Way Capital Area, which is based in Austin. Other pledges have been reduced, she said, "like $100,000 pledges cut to $75,000. It's almost balanced out, and I would have said the same thing before Sept. 11." 
Ultimately, Austin is likely to experience a slowdown in philanthropic giving.
Many local nonprofit groups have already suffered. For example, SafePlace, a center for domestic and sexual abuse, has laid off almost 10 percent of its work force. 
Long-term projects may become even more so. The Austin Museum of Art, which has also laid off staff members, had hoped to raise $92 million in a capital campaign for its endowments and a new building. It has raised about one-third that amount. 
The groundbreaking on the new building has "lost a year," said William J. McLellan, the museum's chief executive. The last significant gifts were made in December 2000, one for $750,000 and another for $300,000. Since then, things have slowed down considerably. 
A year ago, Mr. McLellan said: "There were many people in town who had net worths that would enable them to give us a million dollars. That wealth has disappeared in a lot of cases.
"If the party kept going for a couple more years," he said, "I'd be down there with a hard hat and a shovel. But the party is over."

HEADLINE: SENDING HELP; 
International Agencies Give Aid, While Trying to Avoid the War

BYLINE:  By BILL BERKELEY 

 BODY:
WHEN the huge American transport planes dropped their first cargo of 37,000 ready-to-eat meals over Afghanistan last month, crew members were said to have cheered wildly as the yellow packages labeled "Food gift from the people of the United States of America" fell earthward. No doubt famished Afghans devoured the beans and rice, lentil stew, biscuits, peanut butter, jam and pastries.
 Yet among some veteran humanitarian relief workers, the televised images of American benevolence, broadcast on the eve of the bombing campaign against the Taliban, were cause for disquiet bordering on alarm. Relief workers have complicated memories of humanitarian efforts in places like Somalia and Sudan, Kosovo and northern Iraq, not to mention Afghanistan itself. 
 "When I heard that the dropping of food by U.S. military aircraft was announced as a humanitarian gesture, I had in mind the lessons of Somalia," said Dr. Rony Brauman, a former head of Doctors Without Borders, the Nobel Prize-winning international relief agency, which has been critical of the food drop. 
In 1993, he recalled, an American military operation in Somalia to combat a famine became mired in warlord politics, and 18 American marines and at least 12 humanitarian aid workers were killed by Somali militias. Although the United States tried to present the military campaign as a humanitarian intervention, the warlords were able to persuade their militias of just the opposite -- that the humanitarian intervention was actually part of a military invasion.
Dr. Brauman worries that something similar may happen to relief workers in Afghanistan. "We are viewed as people coming from abroad, maybe having direct relations with Western powers," Dr. Brauman said. "If a Western power confirms this impression, then we become really part of the military drive, and we as aid workers can become transformed into war targets. And this is a problem not just for us, but for the people we are trying to help." 
Not all humanitarian relief professionals share this view, and some support the American airdrops. But given that as many as 7.5 million Afghans are at risk of starving by year's end, many Western relief groups have criticized the Pentagon's food program as little more than public relations.
Relief workers have long struggled with the reality that there is rarely such a thing as pure humanitarian aid -- especially in war. Food and other forms of relief almost always become manipulated for strategic advantage. For instance, if combatants get their hands on food, they can use it to feed themselves -- as has happened for a decade in Sudan. Or they can sell it and enrich themselves -- as happened in Somalia. If refugee camps are established, they can become havens for war criminals -- as happened in eastern Zaire in the mid-90's.
Yet humanitarian aid is never more needed than in a violent conflict. Thus, the never-ending conundrum: how to give aid without prolonging the war, how to comfort the afflicted without refueling the combatants. It is a business replete with murky moral hazards, relief workers say, in which all types of compromises may be necessary.
"War is intense business," said Austen Davis, the director of Doctors Without Borders in the Netherlands. "It is maximum politics, if you like. Your compromises are taken very seriously. At the same time, in the intensity of war, a lot of compromises are accepted."
In Afghanistan, relief aid has been politicized for decades, said Lionel Rosenblatt, former president of Refugees International, an independent aid and advocacy group in Washington. "During the Soviet occupation," he recalled, "the United States subsumed all other interests to the imperative of getting the Russians out. It didn't look to the long-term effect on either Afghanistan or Pakistan."
Instead, the United States channeled food aid through the Islamic militants and armed groups. "Most were not savory characters," Mr. Rosenblatt said.
Even before the current crisis began, the United States Agency for International Development had warned that Afghanistan, after two decades of war and three years of drought, was on the verge of widespread famine. A large percentage of the urban population depended on United Nations agencies for food. In Kabul, half the 1.2 million residents relied on them.
Ahmed Rashid, the author of "Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia," described Afghanistan in 1999 as an economic black hole that was destabilizing a larger region already in severe crisis. He said that basic amenities in even the poorest countries were unavailable in Afghanistan. There was no running water, and other essentials -- electricity, telephones, proper housing -- were almost impossible to obtain.
Now that the war has begun, at least a million people have abandoned their homes, according to Refugees International. Hundreds of thousands have fled cities for the Afghan countryside, a migration that makes emergency food distribution enormously difficult, because relief agencies do not know how to find people.
At the same time, the war has wreaked havoc on existing relief efforts. American bombs have destroyed some aid stockpiles -- a Red Cross warehouse was destroyed by bombs in October. Foreign relief workers have left Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, while Taliban forces have seized United Nations warehouses and relief supplies. Looting and banditry have been reported by nearly every humanitarian aid group.
BEFORE the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States was the largest foreign-aid donor to Afghanistan. Now, the United States Agency for International Development is trying to ensure that 250,000 tons of food are transported into the country by the end of the year, said Andrew S. Natsios, the administrator for the agency..
The effort, Mr. Natsios said, is a crucial part of Washington's campaign to convince the Afghan people that the United States is their friend. But most of this food will probably be trucked into the country by Afghans themselves, who must somehow obtain the cooperation of the powers that be, whether they are Taliban commanders or independent warlords and bandits.
"Very likely, aid providers and their partners will have to deal with local authorities in a highly decentralized and highly militarized environment," said Arthur C. Helton, a senior fellow specializing in refugee affairs at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Inevitably, food is the price of entry and the currency of acquiescence. The deals struck recognize that a percentage reaches combatants and oppressors, but that nevertheless, an understood level reaches needy people."
In Afghanistan, the potential for a huge refugee exodus remains. So far, Afghans do not seem to be fleeing to the Pakistani border in such numbers. But the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has estimated that as many as 1.5 million new refugees may flee to neighboring countries in the next six months. 
Should there be a flood of refugees, humanitarian agencies will undoubtedly have to deal with the political fallout, and that can be dicey. In 1994, for example, more than a million Rwandan Hutus descended on eastern Zaire. Aid agencies quickly faced not only a cholera epidemic, but also the discovery that they were not only feeding innocent refugee women and children, but many Hutu men and boys who had participated in the genocide of more than 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis.
Those loyal to the old Hutu regime used the camps to regroup and start guerrilla attacks on Rwanda. Some agencies, notably Doctors Without Borders and the International Rescue Committee, withdrew from the camps in early 1995.
In the current crisis, the borders around Afghanistan have been officially closed. Pakistan is wary of yet another flood of mostly Pashtun refugees, who could destabilize its fragile government. The United States, in turn, has refrained from pressuring Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president, on this issue, because he has already put his government at risk by helping the military campaign.
There has been some talk of creating safe havens within Afghanistan where displaced people can receive food and shelter. But the history of safe havens is not encouraging. Such zones would need to be protected by thousands of ground troops, which poses its own problems. In 1995, for example, the United Nations created a safe haven in Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. Yet in July 1995, it was overrun by Bosnian Serb forces, who massacred 7,000 Bosnian men and boys in front of 300 Dutch peacekeepers.
"There is no good solution anywhere," said Dr. Brauman of Doctors Without Borders. "There is a war. There is violence. It is an illusion to believe that there can be a clean war with civilians enjoying protection. There is no pure solution. There is no real satisfaction. The only real solution will come with peace."

HEADLINE: TOUGH TIMES, TOUGH CHOICES; 
Charities Get a Big Helping of Uncertainty

BYLINE:  By JOHN O'NEIL 

 BODY:
AFTER an extraordinary string of fat years and rapid growth, the nation's charities are facing the toughest times and toughest choices in decades.
 The shock of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the flood of money pouring into relief efforts, the sudden contraction of the nation's economy, the slump on Wall Street and the recent disruptions in the mail have nonprofit groups rushing to adjust during what is traditionally the busiest fund-raising period of the year. 
 So far, the worst fear of charities in the first days after the attacks -- that support for the relief efforts would come at their expense -- has not come to pass. The early indications, according to more than 30 interviews with philanthropy executives, researchers and consultants, are that, in general, the gifts by individuals to relief efforts are being made on top of, not instead of, their usual donations. And the approximately $1.3 billion given to the relief funds amounts to far less than 1 percent of the $203 billion Americans gave to nonprofit groups in 2000. 
What is happening appears to be both less dire and more complex. There are groups whose revenues have fallen drastically, especially in New York and Washington. Across the country, arts groups and some social service organizations are having difficulties. And many of the thousands of new charities formed during the boom, especially those that relied on stock gifts from the newly rich, may not be able to survive harder times.
But other groups, from the American Diabetes Association and the National Trust for Historic Preservation to the Archdiocese of Boston and Tampa General Hospital, reported in an informal sampling that they had been meeting or exceeding their fund-raising goals. Interest in volunteering has risen sharply, and not only for disaster relief efforts, according to Volunteermatch .com, which links volunteers and causes.
This mix of reactions is even being felt overseas. Dr. Eugene R. Tempel, executive director of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, said he recently attended a conference on philanthropy in Europe, where the prevailing mood was summed up by the leader of a Belgian charity: "We're keeping up, but we're working harder than ever."
The bigger worry now is not the direct aftermath of the attacks but the steep economic slide. Foundations cut their giving when their stockholdings fall; corporations when profits recede. State and local governments are already planning deep budget cuts, and large gifts are often put off during uncertain times. And downturns, of course, also mean more people in need of help.
The result has been a scramble on many fronts. Charities have been making some concrete changes, from rewording the letters in their holiday appeals to canceling trips, postponing projects and in some cases laying off staff members.
But a reassessment of broader trends has begun as well, experts say. The national mood has changed, and the high-powered tactics of the boom years, when no capital campaign goal seemed too big and no gala too glittering, are likely to change as well. Dr. Tempel said that charities could no longer grow simply by chasing big grants or promoting the financial benefits of big donations. "That kind of giving will probably slow," he said.
Leaders of charities large and small spoke in interviews of the need to get back to the basics: serving their communities, explaining their missions and building a base of support one donor at a time. 
"Right now, we're coming back to what you might call demand-side giving," Dr. Tempel said. "You have to talk about people's needs." 
Food for Survival, which distributes food to 1,200 programs throughout New York City, is dealing with needs on both sides of the issue: the aftermath of the attacks and the creeping hardship caused by the downturn. It has become an integral part of the recovery effort, moving 8 to 10 tractor-trailer loads of food each day to feed workers at ground zero. 
Its president, Dr. Lucy Cabrera, is confident that relief funds will cover the costs involved in essentially doubling the group's work. "But we've seen a dramatic decrease in the individual giving" that supports its usual work, she said. Donations fell 25 percent in September and close to 30 percent in October, compared with those in the same months last year. And that work is becoming more pressing, she said. "Even before the disaster we had seen an increase in the demand for food at pantries and soup kitchens," she said. "Since then we've seen a lot more." 
For Dorine N. Gordon, the president of the ALS Association's greater New York branch, the disruption began when the first of the World Trade towers fell, just blocks from her office, and the street below "filled with smoke and screams," she said. She and her staff of 12 fled to safety, were unable to return to work for 10 days and were without reliable phone service for weeks.
The group, which supports services and research for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, felt the financial impact immediately. A fund-raising walk in Liberty State Park that was expected to bring in $100,000 was called off because the area was requisitioned for the recovery efforts. Corporations also disrupted by the attacks began to cancel their tickets for the group's Oct. 30 gala, leaving Ms. Gordon facing a $400,000 shortfall from the event's goal. "It's totally understandable," she said. "They're focusing right now on taking care of their people."
The biggest threat to the Brooklyn Public Library is the citywide budget cuts of up to 15 percent that are now being considered, which would take $11 million out of the library's $85 million budget. That dwarfs the $300,000 the Brooklyn Library Foundation had set as a goal for its Nov. 1 gala. But the foundation's money is crucial to some of the library's most cherished programs, like tutoring in reading skills, and the event has an importance in itself as a means of building a network of support, said Cheryl J. Haywood, a trustee and co-chairwoman of the event. 
Arts organizations traditionally suffer more than other types of nonprofit groups during hard times, said Dr. Patrick M. Rooney, director of research at the Indiana center. "They basically do well when there's a lot of extra income or wealth around," he said. 
But arts groups in New York have been particularly hard hit, and not just in their galas and mail campaigns, said Richard J. Schwartz, the chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts. "The big loss so far has been in earned income -- performances with a lack of attendance, museums with a dearth of tourists and a loss of shopping income," he said.
Causes far from home are also suffering more: a planned $700,000 gift for an H.I.V.-prevention campaign in Africa went to a Sept. 11 fund instead, said Carrie Svingen, a spokeswoman for EngenderHealth, a women's health organization.
Liz Andrews, a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association's Midwestern branch, said that the national organization's fall fund-raising walks could almost provide a map showing the severity of the fund-raising disruption: the closer to New York, or the sooner after Sept. 11, the more poorly they did. Nationwide, the walks -- which were recast as marches, with flags replacing corporate banners -- raised 15 percent more than they did a year ago, she said. That was far better than the organization had feared at first, she said. But it was 10 percent below its goal for the year.
Similarly, Habitat for Humanity International had its "best October in history" but fell short of its "ambitious" goals, a spokesman said.
Ambitions had soared during the boom. According to Melissa S. Brown, the managing editor of Giving USA, which tracks charitable trends, donations have grown steadily since 1987, but the trend really took hold when Wall Street took off in 1995. The fastest-growing portions of the charitable pie have been grants by foundations and corporations and large gifts of stock by individuals. 
Bryan K. Clontz, a vice president at the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta, said that groups like his "live and die by December," when the bulk of big gifts are made toward the end of the tax year. But this year the uncertainty about the economy, the stock market and the estate tax have created "a perfect storm" buffeting upper-income donations. "It creates a lot of fear about making major gifts," he said. 
Dr. Rooney, the Indiana economist, said that businesses also traditionally pulled back on donations in tough times. "Corporations average donations of 1 percent of pretax profit," he said. "When profits go down, so does giving."
As a result, there are many who believe, like Rick Cohen, president of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, that "this is a special moment for foundations."
"They have a role to play," he said, "to shore up the nonprofit community so that nonprofits don't become another victim of the attacks." 
But Sara L. Engelhardt, president of the Foundation Center, which provides information on foundations and corporate philanthropy, said that most foundations were likely to hold to the standard formula of giving 5 percent of assets. Some foundations may dip deeper into their holdings to honor grants already committed. Even so, she said, groups facing shortfalls in other financing should realize that "it's not realistic to expect foundations to make up the difference."
Dr. Rooney said these losses would fall most heavily on newer groups that had not yet developed a solid donor base. Robert F. Sharpe Jr., a nonprofit-group consultant based in Memphis and Washington, was more blunt, predicting a significant winnowing. "A lot of the charities that were formed in recent years aren't going to make it," he said. "They are creatures of discretionary income -- of easy money -- and they're facing a day of reckoning." 

Linking to the Attacks
In the last two months, nonprofit groups have turned to a range of strategies. The most direct -- and the most delicate -- is to stress any link to the events dominating the nation's attention.
Consultants warn, however, that this should be tried only by groups that have a real and significant role. Food for Survival certainly qualifies, and is being reimbursed in full for its expenses in feeding rescue workers. Dr. Cabrera plans extra mailings to try to make up for the shortfall in donations to support the group's regular work and hopes that its role in the city's crisis will translate into broader support.
"We've been a pretty large player in the disaster relief efforts," she said, "and we're able to put that in our appeal as well." 
Public radio stations from Hawaii to Mississippi have recorded their best-ever pledge drives this fall, which executives at National Public Radio attribute to gratitude for its in-depth news coverage of recent events. In New York, WNYC raised $3.1 million to meet the $4 million in damage it suffered during the attacks, more than double its previous one-week record, said a spokeswoman, Emma Dunch.
Sometimes relief-related aid can be provided in a way that helps a group's broader purposes as well as serving a need stemming from the disaster. The New York Times Company Foundation recently gave a $2.5 million matching grant (from the $45 million it has raised for The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund) to the After-School Corporation, a nonprofit group, to open free after-school programs in 16 schools near ground zero.
The South Street Seaport Museum lost about $750,000 when it was forced to close for two weeks by the attacks, said its president, Peter Neill. But the museum has already landed a $30,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for an exhibit on the maritime response to the attacks. 
Another important reaction to the new uncertainty is budget cuts, even in groups that have not had a drop in donations. Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for gay and lesbian rights, said the group's events after Sept. 11 sold out nationwide. "A lot of gay people died in the attacks," she said. "People want to come together to mourn the loss." 
But even so, within 10 days of the attacks she had put in place a contingency plan that included cuts of up to 20 percent. "Any nonprofit would be foolish not to prepare for a shortfall," she said. 
Eileen R. Heisman, president of the National Philanthropic Trust, said she had been cutting what she called the obvious things. "We're looking much more closely at public relations and marketing dollars, at travel," she said. "We're holding off on things that if I put them off a bit, nothing terrible is going to happen." 
Ms. Gordon of the ALS Association's New York branch said she was trying not to pull back on any programs the association had in place. "But we had plans to expand into underserved areas that we're reconsidering," she said, "and we're looking at some research in terms of putting that off." 

Tending to Donors
And charities have been talking. "We're advising our clients to call their donors -- talk, don't just send letters," said Nancy Raybin, a New York consultant and a former chairwoman of Giving USA. "If that means 300 calls, then make 300 calls." 
Philip Coltoff, the executive director of the Children's Aid Society, a New York City charity that has added new relief duties to its regular work, said that he and his staff members were working at "making a connection between what we do for the community and how those services need to be sustained." 
"You take the time and educate your board -- that's your first donor base -- so from there you can have a larger collective effort," he said.
Roger Craver of the direct mail firm Craver, Mathews, Smith & Company said that charities for which his company made telemarketing calls were reporting unusually positive reactions. "People in these situations like to feel like a part of the organizations they have been supporting," he said. "Established donors rarely slack off." 
Mr. Craver also said that so far there had been no sign that the fears about anthrax in the mail had led to any significant drop in responses to fund-raising appeals. H. Robert Weintzen, the president of the Direct Marketing Association, agreed. "We've been expecting to see a falloff, but so far we haven't," he said. 
Mr. Craver said that many charities had modified their fund-raising letters to take account of recent events and that they had been very careful about putting their names and return addresses on very clearly. "People are creatures of habit," he said. "If they know the source of the mail, I suspect they're going to open it and keep on giving." 
Jennifer Leonard, president of the Rochester Area Community Foundation, said that recent fund-raising events there had been attracting many people looking for some way to connect, to find a sense of community. Strong charities and their core of donors have always shared that kind of bond, she said, and groups that can ingrain what she called "habits of the heart" will continue to find support.

Commitments Renewed
In the end, both the ALS dinner and the Brooklyn Public Library's gala did better than their organizers had feared. The ALS Association collected $1 million, down from its $1.2 million goal, but $200,000 ahead of Ms. Gordon's mid-October estimate. And the library's $253,000 in gifts was almost equal to last year's -- also down from the original goal, but better than Ms. Haywood had expected.
But in her mind the greater importance of the event was the renewed commitment inspired by a speaker, the illustrator Leo Dillon. He described the time a half-century ago when he, as an African-American boy, had stopped day after day to stare at the most beautiful book cover he had ever seen, locked in a glass bookcase until a white librarian came over unbidden and handed him the rare and expensive treasure.
"People who heard him talk about how he was transformed by that -- they're going to be our cheerleaders," Ms. Haywood said. "They didn't walk out saying, 'That's the last money I'm giving.' They walked out of there skipping."
To H. King McGlaughon, the director of the Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Management at Merrill Lynch, a new emphasis on deepening such connections could turn out to be a positive. "It's a return to mission-focused fund-raising: talking directly about what you do and the value of your programs to the community," he said. "In the 90's there was a fairly significant trend toward donor gratification."
Nancy Raybin said the long-term challenge would be to build on this fall's extraordinary outpouring of generosity. "We have new philanthropists, and that's a wonderful thing," she said. "If we can get some small percentage of them to keep on giving, then we'll do better as a country." 
Even some leaders of groups getting hard hit are optimistic. "Right now the sympathy is with the disaster, and that's where it should be," said Dr. Cabrera of Food for Survival. "But I have a lot of confidence. New Yorkers always come through."
And Ms. Gordon said her spirits were revived by an ALS walk at Jones Beach on Sept. 30. It was a cold and rainy day, and there had been nothing but bad news for weeks. Then a crowd of 1,000 showed up, bearing pledges for $100,000 more than had been projected. "It was an amazing outpouring," Ms. Gordon said. "These people just wanted to be together."

A Camp Fund As His Legacy
SOME donations are as sad as they are sweet.
Every summer, a Bronx group called Happiness Is Camping operates a free program in Blairstown, N.J., for children with cancer. Medical services are provided by volunteer doctors and nurses from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said Kurt Struver, the group's executive director. 
Eight years ago, Julie E. Siard, a nurse at the camp, met Robert D. McMahon, a New York City firefighter who was also volunteering there, Mr. Struver said. They married and had a son in 1999. This year, Mrs. McMahon became pregnant again. 
On Sept. 11, Mr. McMahon, a member of Engine Company 20 in Chinatown, went into the World Trade Center. His funeral is today. Mrs. McMahon has asked that donations in her husband's memory be made to Happiness Is Camping. "She knows that as a firefighter's widow she's going to be taken care of financially," said Dr. Herbert Janick, Mrs. McMahon's uncle. "She wanted to do something that fits the kind of person he was."
The camp plans to hold a session next July for children of firefighters killed on Sept. 11. In an e-mail to Mr. Struver, Mrs. McMahon wrote, "It never ceases to amaze me how so many positive things can come out of such a disastrous moment."

A rush to appropriatesymbols of the day terror punctured New York's skyline.

BYLINE:  By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
HOPING to find a dark cloud's silver lining, and mine it, more than two dozen enterprising types have applied for trademarks related to the events of Sept. 11.
 All the applications involve slogans and symbols directly related to the terrorist attacks. Most involve trademarks intended for use on general retail merchandise -- the kind of T-shirts, coffee mugs, canvas bags and trinkets sold in tourist shops in Times Square. Many incorporate the date of the attacks with sketches of the twin towers, playing on the fact that the two skyscrapers looked like the number 11. 
 For example, Benjamin Zapp, from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, applied for a trademark for "09-11-01," with the "11" rendered as the twin towers, including an antenna on the left tower, and the slogan "We will always remember" under the date. The image is superimposed on an outline of the American flag. Mr. Zapp says he intends to use the mark for apparel, jewelry, paper goods and ceramic and glassware.
The Patent and Trademark Office, which has not yet registered any of the trademarks related to Sept. 11, said it was still examining them to determine whether they qualify.
Dates, whether written as September 11, 2001, or as 9-11-2001, are usually not eligible by themselves for a trademark. And adding other words, like "September 11th Fund" may not help, either.
Descriptive words cannot win trademarks, said Sharon Marsh, an administrator at the Trademark Office. If applicants use the date in conjunction with other words or emblems, they may win a trademark if they file a disclaimer stating that they expect no rights to the date outside its use in the design. Dates alone, or names like World Trade Center, may not be eligible. 
"If what the party is trying to register just wouldn't be recognized by the public as a mark, then it can be refused," Ms. Marsh said. 
Although most of the Sept. 11 trademark applications are for commercial purposes, several have been submitted for fund-raising, including a request from the United Way of New York City for "The September 11th Fund," and one from the World Trade Center Disaster Relief Fund in Las Vegas for "Walk4America." 
Don Rogers, who lives in Rockville, Md., has applied for trademarks for "World Terrorist Reward Fund" and "USA Terrorist Reward Fund." The September 11th Memorial Fund, in Orlando, Fla., has applied to trademark its name.
The Wall Street Rising Corporation, a nonprofit organization, also wants a trademark on its name. Its application is for the words "Wall St Rising" around a sketch of city skyscrapers. In its request, the organization says it aspires to "promote the retention and location of businesses at and around the location of the World Trade Center."
Michael Heiden, who lives in New York on the Upper East Side, anticipated the trademark rush the day of the attacks. By the end of the day on Tuesday, Sept. 11, he had put together an application to trademark the term "World Trade Center" for use in entertainment like TV programs, videos and movies about the attacks.
In his application, Mr. Heiden explained that he was not trying to exploit a national tragedy -- in fact, he said he wanted to stop others from doing so. "This trademark was originally created and designed for charity purposes," Mr. Heiden wrote. "In the event of any movie made about the horrific act of cowards on Sept. 11, I wanted to make sure that all proceeds went directly to the people affected by this tragedy."
A month later, Mr. Heiden decided not to pursue the trademark, and asked the Patent and Trademark Office to cancel his application. 
The applications are not only by people in the United States. From Israel, Moti Shniberg applied for a trademark covering the words "Sept. 11, 2001" to be used for books, news radio programs, TV news and entertainment shows, theater, musicals, comedy or operas. 
So far, no trademark applications have been filed using "Taliban" or "Al Qaeda." But there are several incorporating variants of the name Osama bin Laden into slogans on clothing, knickknacks or bumper stickers. These include "Osama -- Can you see the bombs bursting in air?" "Trash Bin Laden," "Bin Laden to rest," "Bin there, bombed that," and "Osama, Yo Mama."
Here is a sampling of other timely ideas that trademark applicants have submitted: 
*Suzette Tarantini, Scottsdale, Ariz. "09-11-01, The Day God Needed More Angels" for use on clothing, bumper stickers, memorial statues, computer software or Internet services. 
*Richard Stewart, Venice, Calif. "9-11/911" for clothing, jewelry, shoes and sports equipment. 
*Paul Gross Corporation, San Diego. Exclusive rights to put "Sept. 11" on clothing and shoes.
*Constance Romano, Bradenton, Fla. "Now that we're united, will you meet me halfway?" for use on T-shirts and bumper stickers. The words "united," "you" and "me" appear with red, white and blue stripes.
*Imelda Roberts, Frederick, Md. "Twin Towers Light" for lamps and other commemorative items.
*Hoover & Strong Inc., Richmond, Va. A metal bracelet similar to the POW bracelets popular during the Vietnam War. Each bracelet will bear the name of one victim from the terrorist attacks and the date "9-11-01."
*Liberty Ball Ltd., Concord, N.H. "The Liberty Ball, 9-11-01," featuring an American flag between the words and the date. The design will be used on "golf balls to be sold to benefit the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack."

Software Helps Workers Start -- and Finish

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
Smart security experts often say they do not worry as much about hackers as about disgruntled insiders who might commit acts of sabotage against their company's computers. One of the quickest and easiest ways to upset employees is to give them pink slips -- and there are plenty of those going around lately.
 Business Layers, a two-year-old software company in Rochelle Park, N.J., says it has a way to keep employees from firing digital parting shots. 
 Its flagship product, eProvision Day One, is normally used to help automatically set up new employees with the computing communications equipment and corporate network access that they need. Chevron and dozens of midsized companies use the product.
Now, though, many of the customers that use Day One are finding that the same automated tools can be used to speed up the process of cutting off network access, preventing a fired employee from deleting or altering files or continuing to read or send e-mail messages on the company account. The software even tells the company's technology support staff that someone needs to pick up the former employee's laptop computer and cellphone.
The same software that can help an employee boot up, in other words, can speed the process of booting them out.
As the company's Web site more delicately puts it, the former employees are "systematically, securely and automatically removed from the corporate network." They are "kept productive from day one" by the automated access controls and are "prevented from becoming counterproductive beyond the day they leave." It is the perfect tool, in short, for making those mass layoffs less troublesome -- for the company, at least.
With the United States economy having gone from boom to bust, Day One has watched its software be put to increasingly pragmatic purposes, said David Lavenda, a co-founder of the company. 
"I would say in the last six to nine months, there has been a pretty big shift" among users, he said -- from the first-day, money-saving functions of the product to its last-day defensive uses. 
Companies that have not enrolled new employees with the product can enter them later, Mr. Lavenda said, noting he has received inquiries recently "that are more related to security" from the start.
A name change for Day One is not planned, Mr. Lavenda said.

High-Technology Exports From China Create Tension
China's high-technology industry finds itself treading on geopolitical fault lines these days as Chinese companies have become suppliers of advanced communications equipment to nations that Western companies avoid, or are barred from doing business with, including Iraq, Cuba, North Korea and, at least before Sept. 11, the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan.

Intel Chairman's Wartime Boyhood
While Intel was becoming a Silicon Valley institution, its chairman, Andrew S. Grove, was known for many things: his attention to minute details, his secrecy, his acute paranoia of competitors, his often cantankerous leadership. There was little room for sensitivity or sentimentality. But now, at age 65, Mr. Grove can afford both. He has published a memoir, "Swimming Across," that tells of the experiences -- some mundane, some extraordinary -- of a nonobservant Jewish boy growing up in Hungary through a fascist regime, a Nazi invasion and a Soviet occupation.

He quickly revamped the issue, but he soon faced a bigger, more complex problem: what to do the next month, and the ones after that.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Complain That Chinese Companies Supply Rogue Nations 

BYLINE:  BY JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
China's high technology industry finds itself treading on geopolitical fault lines these days, as Chinese companies have become suppliers of advanced communications equipment to nations that Western companies avoid, or are barred from doing business with. 
 The Chinese customers have included the governments of Cuba, Iraq, North Korea and Yugoslavia and, at least before Sept. 11, the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan. 
 Other than their dealings with Iraq, which were a violation of United Nations sanctions and were halted by the Chinese government after the United States complained in February, the companies have done nothing that violates international trade agreements or diplomatic strictures. Instead, they seem to be exercising the capitalist rights to entrepreneurial aggressiveness and low pricing. 
So far, according to industry analysts and American trade officials, the Beijing government has been responsive to efforts by the State Department to help China set up a rigorous system of export controls to regulate increasingly feisty businesses. Such controls and cooperation are considered crucial now that China has joined the World Trade Organization. 
And American officials say that Chinese companies have not been involved with telecommunications projects in Afghanistan since Sept. 11. Still, some officials remain wary.
"A modernizing China with more aggressive entrepreneurial activity will bleed into diplomatic complications that are sometimes unpredictable," a Bush administration official who has worked closely with the Chinese government on trade issues said.
And the installation of digital fiber optic cables in rogue nations -- or those considered potential rogue nations -- raises concerns in intelligence agencies because the cables are nearly impossible to monitor with conventional ground, air or space surveillance systems. 
Even if fiber optic lines could be tapped, strong modern data-encryption methods can make the information hard to decipher for intelligence gathering. And as with almost all telecommunications systems, the digital equipment has both military and civilian uses. "You can't attack a military target without attacking a civilian target," a Defense Department spokesman said. 
In the Iraq incident earlier this year, Washington accused Chinese telecommunications companies of helping to modernize the Iraqi air defense system, in violation of a United Nations embargo on the sale of military equipment to Iraq. 
Although administration officials say the Chinese government moved quickly to rein in the companies, the episode helped elevate telecommunications to an issue of concern in discussions of technology export controls with China and placed telecommunications systems, along with supercomputers and data encryption, among the technologies that draw scrutiny. 
The ascendancy of these companies is part of a technological vision that combines economic development and national security through a government program known as Project 863, named for a March 1986 letter that four senior Chinese scientists wrote to Chinese leaders criticizing the nation's dependence on Western technology.
"The technology that the United States and its allies have been providing to the Chinese end up propagating in a nonlinear way that is unpredictable and unanticipated," said Peter Leitner, a senior strategic trade analyst for the Defense Department, who has been a forceful opponent of advanced technology transfers to China.
A number of prominent Chinese communications technology companies engage in partnerships with top American manufacturers including Lucent Technologies, Qualcomm, Compaq Computer, Motorola and I.B.M. Other Western producers that have formed partnerships in China include Nortel Networks of Canada, Ericsson of Sweden and Siemens of Germany. 
A longstanding concern has been that through such relationships, Chinese companies might channel technology to parts of the world that American equippers shy away from for diplomatic or security reasons. But the Chinese are not the only ones willing to do business where Americans will not; Alcatel, of France, has agreed to rebuild some of Iraq's civilian telecommunications network.
Industry analysts say that Chinese technology companies are becoming much more competitive in their own right, as the result of research and development efforts complemented by government support. China's four telecommunications manufacturing stars -- Huawei, ZTE, Julong and Datang -- all invest more than 10 percent of their revenue into research and development, a substantial share by international standards.
At this point, the Chinese companies' main advantage is price, which can be as much as 30 percent below that for comparable Western products. "There are countries that don't necessarily need the latest switch or the latest mobile technology, and are price-sensitive," said Ted Dean, managing director for BDA China, a consulting firm that tracks China's telecommunications industry. "The Chinese companies are growing there."
Although the bulk of sales still go to China's huge domestic market, over the last four years the telecommunications manufacturers have exported equipment to more than 20 developing nations including Libya, Pakistan and Yemen.
"There is a certain gray area where certain countries are not blacklisted, but for some reason, U.S. companies don't go," Mr. Dean said. "There is no political pressure from the Chinese government not to sell. In some cases, there might be pressure to sell."
Wendy Wu, a spokeswoman for Huawei, defended the industry's export practices. "Like all other telecom companies," she said, "we operate in different countries. We abide and respect the applicable laws in the countries and the rules by the United Nations. Ms. Wu maintained that contrary to American accusations, "Huawei has never supplied equipment to Iraq." 
In the cases of Cuba and North Korea, Chinese companies are taking advantage of supply vacuums created by American sanctions. Elsewhere, it is a matter of being willing to deal with pariahs. 
In Yugoslavia in September 1999, despite the virtual isolation by then of President Slobodan Milosevic's regime after the Kosovo conflict, ZTE signed a $225 million contract with a Yugoslav telecommunications company to provide equipment, technical support, engineering supervision and training.
ZTE spoke of the sale as a chance to break American and European dominance of communications markets in Eastern Europe. Some diplomats also viewed it as payback of a sort for the inadvertent bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Beijing also extended hundreds of millions in loans to Yugoslavia after the American bombing. 
"One has to assume that in some of those relationships, China is making clear and determined decisions," an administration official said. "However, for whatever narrow self-interest it enters a market or a region, it sometimes discovers after it's gotten involved that it's more complicated than it would have predicted." 
One such case may be in Afghanistan. Even as the United Nations was imposing an arms embargo on the Taliban last December, Afghan news media reported existing agreements to install digital equipment with ZTE and another Chinese company known as CEIEC. The company, formally the China National Electronics Import and Export Corporation, describes itself in its marketing brochure as "the only government-authorized company in China dealing in defense electronics." Among its products are radar, encryption, and navigation systems.
American officials say, though, that there is no evidence of any arms-related work by the Chinese companies in Afghanistan and that the uncompleted telecommunications projects were only rudimentary in a country whose infrastructure has been ravaged by two decades of war. China's foreign ministry has denied any formal relationship with the Taliban.
American officials say that any Chinese work in Afghanistan before Sept. 11 more likely grew out of Beijing's desire to keep an eye on Afghanistan, a bordering country. The government is concerned about Muslim separatists in its western provinces and any relationship they may have with Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network. 
Even projects developed under civilian auspices are of concern to some analysts. "For a country with few phones, the only conceivable purpose for a high-speed data network is governmental or military," James Mulvenon, who analyzes the Chinese military for the RAND Corporation, said.

HEADLINE: CNBC Struggles To Stay Relevant; 
With Stocks No Longer the Big Story, News Viewers Are Looking Elsewhere

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
Think back to the distant past: last year.
 CNBC was something more than a business-news cable channel. It was the winning team's locker room, a cultural phenomenon of the heady 1990's and a mainstay in bars, sports clubs and offices. 
 It became the most-watched information source on cable as its anchors and correspondents reported on the stock market with the same cool confidence with which Internet entrepreneurs strode through Lower Manhattan. Chief executives like Jeff Bezos of Amazon and John T. Chambers of Cisco Systems were treated like rock stars on its programs as the once-stodgy lexicon of Wall Street -- I.P.O., P/E ratio -- became the hip new idiom of the day. 
Now, however, CNBC is in rough seas. Its buzz has faded, its daytime ratings are falling, and it is having to rethink its direction as the ground has shifted beneath it -- with the Sept. 11 attacks, the news has entirely moved away from the investment arena, a trend that was already under way as the economy slowed and stocks slumped.
CNBC executives acknowledge that its slogan, "Profit From It," seems a bit out of place, as can its sundry bells and whistles -- the stock ticker and fancy graphics -- and the occasional, irreverent banter of its anchors.
Just as CNBC's rise was driven by the public's obsession with the stock market and its waning interest in general news from Washington and abroad, the network's decline now reflects the new urgency of foreign affairs and public policy. In fact, the progress of the war on terrorism could affect the economy far more than any other factor.
So CNBC executives are busy trying to plot a new course, one that will focus more closely on general news as it influences the economy while treating market coverage less like a sports event, with less fanfare and less of the network's jocular tone.
By doing that, its executives face a tough question: How can they reposition the network without becoming New Coke?
The job falls to a new chief executive, Pamela Thomas-Graham, who, though considered a young talent, has relatively little experience running a network. She has taken over for Bill Bolster, one of television's looming figures, a master of marketing and TV gimmickry who is now running CNBC International.
There is plenty at stake. Though CNBC remains a huge profit center for NBC, its advertising revenues are believed to have dropped some this year. It is struggling to end the year on par with last year, though executives say it will. CNBC's core advertisers, financial services companies, for weeks after Sept. 11 avoided advertising and some are only now returning.
Ms. Thomas-Graham, who is 38 years old and has spent most of her career as a media management consultant and partner at McKinsey and Company, does not try to skirt the difficulties she faces.
But she maintains that things could be worse and that CNBC has retained its core business audience.
Ms. Thomas-Graham said that because the economy was in decline well before the terrorist attacks, "CNBC was already in a challenging period." She added, "Sept. 11 has given everything more urgency and more focus."
CNBC's daytime ratings are falling even as cable-news viewership overall has increased tremendously since the attacks. The audiences of CNN, the Fox News Channel and MSNBC have doubled and tripled, joined in part by some of CNBC's business-news viewers.
CNBC is losing audience during its most important period, the business day from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. In that period, CNBC is being watched at any given moment, on average, in 273,000 households, 13 percent fewer than last year.
Meanwhile, the average audience for its flagship, evening business program, "Business Center," is one-fourth that of "Lou Dobbs Moneyline" on CNN since Sept. 11. "Moneyline" is clearly riding the CNN ratings surge. But it had been trailing "Business Center" for a couple of years in the most visible sign of CNBC's strength.
CNBC's saving grace so far has been the general-news oriented "Rivera Live," which has greatly contributed to a 32 percent rise in CNBC's prime-time audience over a year ago. But the program will end next week when its host, Geraldo Rivera, becomes a war correspondent for the Fox News Channel.
Mr. Rivera's departure has been portrayed as motivated by his desire to seek adventure as a war correspondent. But CNBC did not exactly bar the door.
Disagreeing with the NBC News executives who controlled their prime-time schedule, CNBC executives had resented Mr. Rivera's presence for some time. Back when business news was hot, CNBC executives said Mr. Rivera's general-news talk show blocked the possibility of more profitable business programming. Mr. Rivera's program does not go over well with advertisers, who shy away from its controversial tone.
But the program has also worked as a hedge against bad business-news cycles. Just as CNN lags in the ratings when the general-news environment is slow, CNBC lags in the ratings when the general-news environment is good. Mr. Rivera's program tends to capitalize on big general-news events. Watched on average by 650,000 viewers since Sept. 11, it often has the largest audience on the network.
Ms. Thomas-Graham said CNBC would replace "Rivera Live" with a business-news program. The new program, she said, would reflect the network's new broader focus. The program does not yet have a name or a specific format, she said. But people at CNBC said Tyler Mathisen, a CNBC anchor, would be its Washington host and would focus on budgetary politics, the Federal Reserve and the war abroad.
Mr. Mathisen, they said, would be named CNBC's Washington bureau chief, a new visible position for the network, which has been almost completely New York-centric.
"We've added more general-news coverage," Ms. Thomas-Graham explained, because "we believe that business leaders are asking for more information from Washington and more information from the war zone."
This, she said, is not inconsistent with CNBC's role as a provider of information vital to the economy. "For instance, anthrax is general news, but it clearly does move the markets we cover," she said.
During the day CNBC has reported heavily on the war, including coverage from the MSNBC correspondent Ashleigh Banfield in Islamabad, and nightvision video of the bombing in Afghanistan. CNBC has also shown the same White House and Pentagon briefings as have the general-news networks.
Taken together, the changes signal a shift in philosophy for CNBC. It rode to prominence by treating each day on the stock market much like a sports event, sandwiched between pre-game and post-game shows. Wisecracking anchors had just the right pitch for the hyperventilating economy.
"I think that my approach to business news is less about the sports analogy," Ms. Thomas-Graham said.
CNBC's longtime slogan, "Profit From It," may soon be changed to something more fitting for the times, she said. She would not say what new slogans are being considered.
But there are differing opinions inside and outside NBC as to just how far CNBC should stray from its trademark style. General news is already well covered by CNN, the Fox News Channel and MSNBC. Some fear CNBC could lose its identity by becoming more broadly focused.
"Just as CNN had the risk that they were trying to chase Fox and get more personality driven, CNBC has the same sort of risk of trying to go much more mainstream-news and losing its brand identity," said Tom Wolzien, senior media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. "When the market place, when these very strange times we're in, become more stable, they would lose their clear differentiation."
Ms. Thomas-Graham said she was aware of this, and she was being careful not to alienate viewers by being "knee-jerk" in the changes she was making.
In the meantime, CNBC correspondents and anchors are trying to tone down some of their irreverence and to judiciously include general-news items. "It's a really hard editorial challenge," a CNBC anchor, David Faber, said. "What should be included? When do you take a press conference of Tom Ridge?" he added, referring to the director of homeland security.
Others at CNBC said they were confident that its strong ratings would be back soon.
"In the relatively near future," Ron Insana, another CNBC anchor, said, "given the concerns about the economy, this is the story that naturally gravitates back toward us -- absent a military failure overseas that is meaningful, or another attack."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Reasons to Give Are as Varied as Donors

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN CARROLL 

 BODY:
Donors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund often cite personal encounters with the city's needy as inspiration for their gifts -- whether it's the disabled panhandler on 42nd Street they pass every day or someone down on his luck whom they've read about in the articles that appear in The Times each winter. 
 But sometimes, unexpected windfalls, happy occasions or just plain thankfulness prompt people to remember New York City's poor during gentler seasons. 
 Throughout the spring, summer and fall, donations continued to arrive at P.O. Box 5193. In its 2000-2001 appeal that ended last March, the fund received 12,291 donations totaling $8,033,582.22, the largest amount raised in its 90-year history. 
In August, Charles Drew of Manhattan sent a check for $300 to the fund, accompanied by a note. "Dear Editor: Your paper has carried many articles about President Bush's refund check," he wrote. "One letter from a reader, who obviously was going to spend it, suggested to those who did not approve of the refund to donate it to charity. This is what I am doing. I hope it encourages others."
Mr. Drew, an actor born in Port Washington, N.Y., said he had been reading the stories of those who benefited from the fund for 50 years. He was inspired to send his tax refund to a charity that benefits his neighbors. "The people they help just need a little help to get to live normally. These are poor people starving in their apartments," he said. 
"I thought that if the purpose of the tax refund was to boost the economy, this was the best way to do that," Mr. Drew said. 
In May, the fund received 25 separate donations honoring the wedding of Jeremy Barnum and Caitlin Macy, who had suggested giving to the fund as a way to celebrate their marriage without giving a gift. 
When planning the wedding, "We felt our cup runneth over, and the implied solicitation for gifts made us both balk," Ms. Macy said. "We did register, but if people asked, we also mentioned the charity as a suggestion."
Donating to the fund is a tradition for the couple. At Christmastime in 1999, their first holiday together, both Ms. Macy, a fiction writer, and Mr. Barnum, a trader at J. P. Morgan Chase, were celebrating the close of banner years. Her first novel was in bookstores, and he was celebrating a profitable year on Wall Street. 
Surrounded by plenty, Ms. Macy felt a tugging need to share the wealth, which she expressed to Mr. Barnum. So when he presented her with a jewelry box, there was an extra gift alongside a new pearl necklace: a check made out to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
"It feels very direct," she said. "You give money, and later you read about how the money is used, exactly." Because The New York Times Company Foundation pays for the fund's administration costs, every dollar goes to those in need. 
In March, Sophia Ryan of Larchmont, N.Y., then 16, mailed in a check to the fund for $350, raised during a luncheon she organized at her school. About 60 attendees paid $5 each for a feast of soups and breads donated by local stores and cookies baked by students, as well as a few unexpected homemade dishes of lasagna and quiche.
The idea for the luncheon came from her own surroundings at Mamaroneck High School. "Everyone here is so generous, you just have to focus that generosity and funnel it toward a common cause," she said. 
Sophia was inspired to do just that after learning that Dr. John Ruskay, chief executive of the UJA-Federation of New York, one of seven local charities that benefit from the Neediest Cases Fund, organized a class donation to the fund when he was a grade-school student in Cedarhurst, N.Y. 
"I wanted to make a significant donation, to really try and help as many people as I could," she said. 
In Larchmont, Ms. Ryan does not often encounter people who may have received aid from the fund. Even if she did, she said, "I don't know that I would feel the need to discuss it with them. It's not something that needs to be discussed, just something that needed to be done. If it helps someone, that's what's really important."

HEADLINE: Pittsburgh Jury Sentences Man To Death in Racial Killing of 3 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
After two days of deliberation, a jury decided today that a black man should be sentenced to death for killing three white men in a racially motivated shooting rampage.
 The man, Ronald Taylor, 41, was convicted on Friday in the March 1, 2000, violence that started at his apartment in suburban Wilkinsburg and continued at two nearby restaurants. 
 The jury could have decided that Mr. Taylor should spend life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
Judge Lawrence O'Toole will sentence Mr. Taylor, but he is bound by the jury's decision on the three first-degree murder charges. No date was set for the formal sentencing, which will make Mr. Taylor the 246th person on Pennsylvania's death row.
"I feel Mr. Taylor brought it on himself," said Michaela Sanielevici, whose 20-year-old son, Emil, was among those killed.
Defense lawyers had argued that Mr. Taylor was insane and suffered from delusions that whites were persecuting him. At the time of the killings, he was unemployed and receiving disability checks because of mental illness.
One defense lawyer, Lisa Middleman, had asked the jurors to show compassion because of Mr. Taylor's mental state.
Prosecutors maintained that Mr. Taylor knew what he was doing when he singled out whites. Even a defense psychiatrist testified that Mr. Taylor had an awareness that killing was considered wrong.
In the trial, prosecutors showed jurors copies of hate writings found in Mr. Taylor's apartment that railed at whites, Jews and gays. One of the writings said, "Jesus Christ made a very big, costly mistake by putting white trash people on the face of the earth."
Mr. Taylor was convicted of killing a maintenance man at his apartment and two men at nearby fast-food restaurants. Two other men were wounded in the shootings at the restaurants.

HEADLINE: Sagging Economy Threatens Health Coverage 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
Yohannes Gezu is one of the economic casualties of the terrorist attacks. A well-paid waiter at a big Chicago convention hotel before Sept. 11, he is now lucky to get a few days of work a week.
 Just as troubling for a man with a stay-at-home wife and a 1-year-old son, Mr. Gezu says he will also soon be confronted with paying a $400-a-month premium if he wants to keep his family's health insurance. "How can you afford to pay $400?" he asks. 
 As the economic downturn takes hold, the plight of people like Mr. Gezu underscores the vulnerability of most Americans' health coverage. Sixty-five percent of Americans under 65 get insurance through their employer, meaning that the loss of a full-time job can quickly translate into the loss of health benefits.
A 1986 federal law allows people to keep their health insurance even after they lose their jobs, but they must pick up the full cost of the premiums -- a huge burden for someone laid off, as much as $500 or $600 a month for coverage of a family, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
At the same time, state officials and health care experts are warning that the basic government safety net for covering low-income people -- the Medicaid program, jointly financed by the states and the federal government -- is under increasing strain. Declining tax revenues because of the economy, rising health care costs and an expected jump in the Medicaid caseload because of layoffs all make for a dangerous combination, officials say.
"States need help," Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican who is chairman of the National Governors Association, declared last week in an appeal to Congressional leaders. "Increasing the federal share for Medicaid would be a way to put desperately needed funds where governors need them the most -- providing health care to poor families."
These health care needs are now entangled in the fiercely partisan debate over the economic stimulus package in the Senate. Democrats are backing a plan that would provide $9 billion to cover 75 percent of the premiums of people who have lost their jobs since Sept. 11 and are trying to keep their private insurance. Their plan would also provide $5 billion to increase the federal contribution to Medicaid, and another $3 billion for states that want to help unemployed workers not otherwise eligible for assistance with coverage.
Republicans say the Democratic plan is too costly, not focused enough on the neediest Americans and runs the risk of creating an expensive new entitlement. Although the premium assistance in the bill would be limited to just over a year, some Republicans say it is hard to let a program lapse once it develops a constituency.
Democrats counter that the Republicans, who provided a $3 billion grant for health care in the economic stimulus plan that passed the House, are more concerned about rewarding big corporations with tax cuts than helping the unemployed.
Behind the partisan fight are people scrambling to adjust. Connie Cretsinger, 58, furloughed last month from her job at United Airlines outside Chicago, figures she will pay the $173 a month it will take to maintain her individual health insurance coverage. With a history of breast cancer, she cannot afford to let her insurance lapse, she said.
But Krystyna Oskierko, a single mother laid off from her job at an airline catering company in Chicago, said she did not see how she could afford to keep her coverage for herself and her 13-year-old daughter. She takes home just $153 a week in unemployment, she said. "Cobra is expensive," she said. "I don't have the money for it."
She was referring to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, the 1986 law intended to provide a bridge for workers between jobs. It has been used by millions of workers, but it has major holes; for example, it does not apply to people who work for small businesses, with fewer than 20 workers.
Most significantly, health experts and advocates say, it is expensive. It requires workers to pay the full cost of their health insurance premiums, plus 2 percent for administrative costs. That could eat up half or two-thirds of the average monthly unemployment benefit, analysts note.
"The vast majority of the public doesn't understand the problems associated with Cobra," said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal advocacy group. "Cobra provides a very crucial right for recently laid off people, but it is unaffordable for the intended beneficiaries to exercise that right."
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, the Connecticut Republican who is chairwoman of the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, argues, "The problem with the Democratic approach is that it sounds nice on paper, but low-income people on the whole don't work for companies covered by Cobra." She defended the House Republican approach -- a $3 billion grant to the states -- and argued that it gave states the flexibility to help those who need it most.
Health analysts say there are two different populations that will need help in a serious downturn -- those eligible for Cobra, who could take advantage of it with an adequate subsidy, and those who could obtain health coverage through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program.
The Cobra population is more middle class, and may not qualify for programs aimed at lower-income parents and their children. (Lower-income people without children often fall between the cracks of both systems, advocates say.)
Moreover, many Democrats believed it would be easier to win support for money to maintain private health insurance through Cobra than to expand government programs. Conservatives are often dismayed at the idea of expanding Medicaid, a Great Society program like Medicare that liberals once hoped would be the precursor of universal health insurance.
What is clear, a range of health experts say, is that recessions -- if this is a recession -- take a heavy toll on health coverage. In the downturn of 1990-92, more than half of the workers who lost their jobs became uninsured, according to Families USA. In fact, the intense anxiety among the middle class about their health care sparked Bill Clinton's campaign in 1992, and his failed effort to enact universal coverage in 1994. "Health security" was the catch phrase, aimed squarely at the anxious middle class.
Robert J. Blendon, an expert at Harvard on public opinion and health, predicted: "It will take a little while, and then I think we'll see this issue re-emerge. Like '92, we have premiums going up, people losing jobs, people losing health insurance who traditionally thought they had it, and people finding no real safety net of coverage."

Equality at Trade Talks: No Country Gets a Vote

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: DOHA, Qatar, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
World trade ministers say they fear that they will deliver a shock to the world economy unless they agree to liberalize trade at their meeting here. But the only shocking thing may be if they manage to agree on anything at all.
 The World Trade Organization, the umbrella trade body, is sometimes described as the ultimate capitalist club, but it is far from exclusive. It has 144 members -- with the addition of China and Taiwan this weekend -- including many of the poorest as well as the richest countries. The United States, Uruguay and Uganda have exactly the same voting power, which is none. 
 Voting is forbidden. Even the United Nations General Assembly's rule of one country one vote smacks of a tyranny of the majority to ministers here. The trade organization operates by consensus, meaning that the smallest holdout can in principle sink the weightiest agreement.
If discussions get that far, that is. Two years ago in Seattle, the last time the organization called together its sponsors for what it calls a ministerial, delegates never fully agreed on procedures for deciding if they agreed on the trade issues at stake.
Some poor countries complained bitterly about a so-called green room, where selected delegates haggled over details. Though anything they decided there was liable to be rejected by the all-inclusive plenary, talk of conspiratorial cabals felled the entire enterprise.
This time, ministers gathering in this Persian Gulf state decided to make the least hierarchical of multilateral institutions more democratic. Any country that wants to participate in any discussion at any time is at least theoretically permitted to do so, with delegate counts and the need for sleep the only limiting factors.

A Twisted Flow Chart
 This is how it works. The chiefs of the delegations select facilitators to build consensus on various issues. The facilitators convene working groups of people intrigued by a particular issue. The groups themselves can subdivide to debate proposals. Working groups draft text to be reviewed by delegation leaders, any one of whom can start the cycle all over again.
One anti-globalization group attending the meeting passed out leaflets protesting "domination of the heavyweights." But the United States disguises its power well. In one recent session to debate a particularly thorny dispute over patent rules, a lone American delegate was swamped by representatives of Brazil, India, Kenya and Zimbabwe, who did not share the American perspective.
The consensus approach has its origins in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a cold war-era forum for deciding trade policy that operated like a gentlemen's club. At the trade organization, its supposedly more potent successor, officials talk more about the art of gelling and coalescing than about making decisions.
Keith Rockwell, the trade organization's spokesman, was pressed today to reveal something -- anything -- that had been agreed to after three days of talks.
"Reaching agreement ahead of schedule is not something for which we are famous," he deadpanned.
The World Trade Organization may make the United Nations look like a model of corporate efficiency. But the trade group has an edge in diplomacy.

Trade-Dollar Diplomacy
 Though the ministers have come to Qatar, a conservative Islamic society that borders Saudi Arabia, Israel's delegation is here en masse, with three ministers and a large team of negotiators. It is the first meeting in the region to accept an Israeli delegation in two years, said Majallie Whbee, the director of Israel's Ministry of Regional Cooperation.
"Our view is that from the economic side we can build confidence and build peace," he said.
India and Pakistan do not have good relations at home and are often conspicuously cool toward each another abroad. But not at the trade meeting.
The two nations are founding members of the Like Minded Group, half a dozen developing countries that press rich countries to open their markets to exports of the poor, like textiles.
When reporters today questioned Munir Akram, Pakistan's permanent representative to the trade organization, on subtle differences in the trade goals of India and Pakistan, he demurred. "I do not wish to disagree with the distinguished minister from India," he said with a smile.
Trade does not soften all rivalries, however. China and Taiwan spend billions of dollars in two-way trade. They both entered the trade organization during this meeting. But China used its sway to make sure that Taiwan's accession ceremony came a day after its own. 
Moreover, while China's membership documents use the title People's Republic of China, Taiwan had to settle for Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, the latter three being tiny islands under Taiwan's control. Chinese Taipei was permitted as shorthand.
The 1999 meeting in Seattle, the trade group's last such meeting, attracted a dozen heads of state, including President Clinton, two dozen members of Congress, hundreds of trade negotiators and tens of thousands of protesters. Qatar is another story.
The location is remote. The global economy is weak. There is a war on. And Americans were warned of credible threats of terrorism. Many lawmakers and government trade experts and at least one cabinet member, Commerce Secretary Don Evans, stayed home.
The defections took a toll. European nations have 508 delegates. Japan comes in second with 159. Canada has 62. The United States barely ranks in the top 10, with 51. Indonesia has 60.
Peter Allgeier, the deputy United States trade representative, acknowledged that his contingent would have been larger in normal times, but called the team "pared-down, effective and cooperative."
Is the United States underrepresented? "We haven't missed a single meeting that we wanted to attend," he said.

HEADLINE: Electric Cars May Lose Push In Northeast 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
Two years after New York, Massachusetts and Vermont announced that they would require the sale of electric cars, they are considering postponing that requirement by four years and promoting the use of other emission-reduction technologies instead.
 State officials say the change could actually produce a deeper cut in tailpipe pollution in the first few years, while giving car companies needed flexibility. Environmental groups question that claim and say the plan may not be legal. Most important, they say, a retreat by the Northeast states would damage efforts to make electric cars commonplace and economically viable. 
 The move would leave California as the only state requiring sales of electric cars over the next several years, cutting the market for them roughly in half. California's plan begins with the 2003 model year, which goes on sale in just 9 to 10 months. It requires that at least 10 percent of the cars sold by each manufacturer be much cleaner than current cars, and that 2 percent be zero-emission vehicles, or ZEV's -- in other words, electric-powered.
Two years ago, Gov. George E. Pataki's administration, followed by Massachusetts and Vermont, adopted the California regulation with considerable fanfare, boasting that the Northeast would help create a national market for electric vehicles. The proposed rule now under consideration would take effect in the 2007 model year.
"It's hard to believe that Governor Pataki, arguably one of the most vocal electric vehicle advocates, would consider a four-year delay in the program," said Peter M. Iwanowicz, director of environmental health for the American Lung Association of New York State. "The ZEV program is the key to a long-term strategy to rein in emissions, and any delay is a setback, and long-term air quality will suffer."
Top environmental officials of the three Northeast states insist that the change is, at this point, just an idea that they are weighing. But they spent several months negotiating it with the auto industry, producing a detailed proposed regulation. Officials in all three states say they expect it to take effect. New York's environmental conservation commissioner, Erin Crotty, said her department would decide next month whether to adopt the rule. She said postponing the electric car mandate would simply be a recognition that automakers are not yet ready to produce them. "While New York is very committed to zero-emission vehicles, they do have technology constraints," she said.
Automakers have protested for years that they would be unable to make commercially viable electric cars in time to meet the California mandate. The electric cars produced now run on batteries, have limited ranges and must be recharged frequently, making them less attractive to consumers. Car companies are betting instead on fuel cells to power electric cars, but that technology still needs improvement. Fuel cells use oil, natural gas or other fuels to produce electricity through chemical reactions, not combustion.
For the last decade, New York has consistently been the leader among the handful of Northeast states that have gone along with each step of the California Air Resources Board's emissions reduction program. Environmentalists credit that program, which is stricter than federal rules, with helping to drive advances in pollution control.
The Northeast states' participation has roughly doubled the share of the national car market operating under the California rules, to about 20 percent. In some cases, that has helped set a de facto national standard, as automakers have decided to build cars for the entire country that meet California standards.
California requires that by next year, 10 percent of vehicles sold must produce far less pollution than cars sold now. While 2 percent must have no emissions at all, the other 8 percent can have some, using technologies like more advanced versions of gas-electric hybrids now on the market, and seals that prevent fuel vapors from escaping.
The proposed Northeast rule would push the plan back by four years. In the interim, it would allow automakers to earn credit against the future requirement by producing alternatives like hybrids. California also awards credits, but the Northeast plan would give far more. For example, the sale of one advanced hybrid next year would relieve the maker from having to produce 12 electric cars in 2007.
The Northeast plan would also allow car companies to earn ZEV credits by using existing technology to cut pollution from light trucks, vans and sport-utility vehicles, which are not covered by California's plan. Officials involved in drafting the rule said the Pataki administration had insisted on that provision, which was ardently sought by the manufacturers.
For the first several years under the plan, "We'll actually end up with far more of the vehicles being very clean" and lower overall emissions, said Sonia Hamel, the Massachusetts director of air policy and planning.
Ms. Crotty, the New York environmental chief, said, "The alternate compliance plan is intended to get more, cleaner cars out there sooner." She said she did not know if the proposed rule would cut emissions more in the short run than California's, saying that was a central question her department was studying.
Environmentalists are extremely skeptical of such claims, and argue that they miss the point.
"What this program is primarily about is jump-starting the production of vehicles with no tailpipe emissions, zero, none," said Roland J. Hwang, senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Until this technology takes off and starts to take over a big chunk of the marketplace, the reductions you get are fairly small, but when you get to that point, the benefits become huge."
Congress long ago authorized California to adopt pollution rules that are more stringent than the national standards. It gave other states a choice between accepting California's rules as their own, or living with those set by the federal government. Environmental groups say that federal law might prohibit states from charting a third course, and that they are deciding whether to sue if the Northeast plan is adopted. When asked if the plan was legal, Ms. Crotty said she was not certain.
Mr. Pataki's environmental record is a central part of his crossover appeal, as a Republican governor in a state that leans heavily Democratic. Democrats have made clear that as he prepares to run for re-election next year, they will make an issue of what they call a pattern of environmental programs that do not live up to their original intent.
In 1999, the governor announced that he would impose the toughest pollution controls in the nation on old power plants. So far, he has put no rule into effect, and the proposed rule does not go quite as far, or as quickly, as the plan he outlined two years ago. In the meantime, a few other states have imposed stricter standards.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE IMMIGRATION AGENCY; 
Effort to Discover Terrorists Among Illegal Aliens Makes Glacial Progress, Critics Say

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA and CHRISTOPHER DREW 

 BODY:
In placing the Justice Department on a wartime footing, Attorney General John Ashcroft has ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service to lead the charge in ferreting out potential terrorists among the nation's illegal immigrants.
 But on the ground, the order is being translated into reality at a glacial pace, if that, critics say. 
 Even though at least three of the Sept. 11 hijackers were in the country illegally, the immigration agency has not been culling its files of other people here on expired visas, saying that the pool is too big to make it a useful tool in finding terrorists.
Nor is the agency quickly able to track people coming in and out of the country, since its antiquated system still records such information in paper files. About 200 people have been detained on immigration violations as part of the terrorism investigation, but nearly all of them were identified by federal or local law enforcement officers, not by immigration agents. 
Indeed, the terror attacks have laid bare the country's longstanding ambiguity on the question of what to do about illegal immigration. Before Sept. 11, the Bush administration was engaged in serious negotiations to offer legal status to some of those immigrants, particularly Mexicans, who were in the country illegally.
Guest worker programs had been expanded, workplace raids had been suspended and much of the focus was on the economic benefits of attracting foreign workers.
But since the terror attacks, the political pendulum has swung toward greater caution, and the immigration service is trying to shift course.
In the hours after the World Trade Center towers fell, for instance, New York City police officers and F.B.I. agents rushed to the Port Authority bus terminal to check for possible accomplices on buses bound for Canada.
They stopped two Middle Eastern men, who admitted to overstaying their visas, police officials said. But when immigration agents arrived at the scene, they let the men go, just as as if nothing had changed that day.
Since then, law enforcement officials say, the immigration agency has been working more closely with the F.B.I. and detaining the illegal immigrants that are the bureau's target. But in recent interviews, immigration officials said they did not want to be seen as singling out Middle Eastern men, and they did not plan to search for undocumented immigrants on their own.
"No raids, no roundups, none of that," said Joseph Greene, the immigration agency's assistant commissioner for investigations.
So it remains to be seen just what the service will do to carry out the new initiatives set out by President Bush, who recently pledged that the government would become "very diligent with our visas and observant with the behavior of people who come to this country."
Critics on Capitol Hill are not optimistic, saying the service has been managed too poorly for too long to be fixed without even more radical changes. But while that debate goes on in Washington, the new reality is becoming clear in the courthouses where deportation cases are heard.
That was evident in Newark recently when an immigration judge, William Strasser, turned to a Pakistani man sitting before him in forest-green jail-house scrubs and spelled out the new rules of engagement. Immigration violations, the judge declared, would no longer be handled as they had been in the past.
"We live in different times than a year ago, you understand me?" Judge Strasser said. "There weren't threats before, possible threats."
The Pakistani man, Azhar Iqbal, 36, had been smuggled into the country with a forged visa and had been picked up in mid-October by the police and federal agents with several other Pakistani men in an apartment in Ardsley, a Westchester County town. He was quickly deemed to be of no use to the F.B.I. terrorism investigation and was held in jail on immigration charges.
As it has done with all the detainees who have been picked up since Sept. 11, the immigration agency objected to releasing Mr. Iqbal on bond.
In many cases, those objections have been overruled. But with Mr. Iqbal, Judge Strasser asked him why he should be allowed to stay in the country.
As it turned out, Mr. Iqbal had no good reason other than his own desperation. Barely able to communicate in English, he said something about floods having ravaged his family's farm in Pakistan. He told the judge he had paid a smuggler $16,000 to come into this country. "I stay for work, some money," he mumbled. "I am very poor. Flood in Pakistan."
The judge ordered him to leave the country in 30 days, and for him to be released from the custody of the immigration service in the meantime on an $8,000 cash bond. Though the judge entered his order on Oct. 26, Mr. Iqbal has not yet come up with the bond money.
Other detainees have also found that getting out of jail is not an easy feat.
Mahmood Abbasi, a limousine driver who had lived in this country illegally for more than a decade, was detained on Oct. 8. But even after a judge authorized his release on a $10,000 bond, and his family came up with the cash, it took eight days and a complaint to the immigration judge to obtain his release, said Mr. Abbasi's lawyer, Roland Gell.
The latest crackdown is being driven by Mr. Ashcroft and other top officials, who say there is no easier way to prevent further terrorist attacks than enforcing immigration laws.
Many of the arrests have come from traffic stops, old warrants for petty crimes and tips about suspicious activities from neighbors. So far, the focus is on people of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent, though more subtle distinctions are being made.
Mr. Gell said another client, an Indian man nicknamed "the pilot," was questioned by F.B.I. agents shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks. He, too, had overstayed his visa. But when they learned he was a Hindu, and not a Muslim like the hijackers, the F.B.I. released him.
Still, the difficulties in picking through the vast pool of illegal immigrants, and deciding which ones might be connected to terrorists, are immense.
Last year, more than seven million foreigners arrived with tourist visas, while the State Department issued more than 100,000 temporary work visas and 280,000 student visas. Of the estimated eight million illegal immigrants now thought to be here, 40 percent are believed to have overstayed their visas.
In the past, illegal immigrants usually came to the agency's attention only if they were caught in a smuggling ring or picked up in a workplace raid. "If you laid low, life was fine," said Janet Sabel, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society.
But critics, including several powerful members of Congress, say that can no longer be tolerated.
Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican who heads the House Judiciary Committee, said the immigration service had been so poorly managed that some 250,000 immigrants who had received deportation orders were still in the country illegally.
"It's not just immigration enforcement," Mr. Sensenbrenner said in an interview. "Talk to anyone who has tried to get a green card for themselves or their loved ones. They will tell you that that part of the I.N.S. is just as incompetent."
Mr. Ashcroft said on Thursday that he planned to address these problems by breaking the immigration agency into two services, separating border enforcement from immigration processing. Mr. Sensenbrenner supports this general idea. But he has also proposed legislation to create a new post high in the Justice Department to take control of the immigration bureaus.
Mr. Sensenbrenner also said that Congress had more than tripled the immigration service's spending authority since 1993, and he had little patience for the notion that a lack of money had delayed its efforts to create a better immigrant tracking system.
But some experts warned that even with half of the 1,900 immigration enforcement agents assigned to work with the F.B.I., there were limits to what could be done.
"We're at risk of developing an exaggerated view of what immigration law can do in response to terrorism," said David Martin, a former immigration service general counsel who is now a law professor at the University of Virginia. "There's all this talk of monitoring either students or anyone who comes in on temporary admission. Those may be very good in their own right.
"But it's not an efficient way to win the struggle against terrorism."
And even as the talk is tougher on illegal immigration, there is, in truth, no rush to deport most of the illegal immigrants in the country.
In fact, the service recently encouraged illegal immigrants to report tips on terrorists and anthrax scares without fear of being caught.
And last month, on his visit to New York City, the commissioner of immigration, James W. Ziglar, urged illegal immigrants who had lost jobs or their family breadwinners in the trade center attacks to seek government relief, also without fear of retribution from the agency.
Mr. Ziglar said the service would not ask for the victims' immigration status. "We would not use that information against them," he said. "Frankly, we don't want that information."

HEADLINE: Lost Jobs, Ragged Safety Net 

BYLINE:  By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich, former labor secretary, teaches economic and social policy at Brandeis University and is author of "The Future of Success."

 BODY:
The economic fallout from terrorism is hitting some Americans much harder than others, and we need to respond. Last year, when the slowdown began, layoffs and pay cuts hit hardest at manufacturing workers, white-collar managers and professionals. But since the terrorist attacks, consumers have cut their spending, and now a different group is experiencing the heaviest job losses: the mostly low-paid workers in America's vast personal-service sector.
 With retail sales down, there's less need for sales clerks. Half-empty hotels don't need nearly as many cleaners and bellmen. Vacant convention halls have no use for platoons of custodians and staffers. Unfilled restaurants can't keep waiters and busboys busy. And so on through all the workers who attend, drive, pamper, launder, polish, clean, prepare and otherwise make life more pleasant for the people who pay them. 
 In October 439,000 private-sector jobs were lost -- the largest monthly decline in more than a quarter-century. Hotels alone lost 46,000; retailers, 81,000; airlines, 42,000. Minority workers, with a disproportionate share of low-wage service jobs, have been especially hard hit. Unemployment among blacks rose to 9.7 percent last month, a full percentage point higher than in September and up 2.3 points from a year ago. Unemployment among Hispanics is 2.2 percentage points higher than it was last year at this time.
There is reason to expect that job cuts at the lower end of the wage scale will get even larger and occur even faster in the months ahead. That's because so much consumer spending is discretionary, turning more on psychological wants than on physical needs. Consumers don't have to dine outside the home, travel, enjoy live entertainment or go on shopping binges. They can choose to spend less on these services as soon as their wallets feel even slightly pinched. And when they do, lower-wage workers feel a bigger pinch. The Fiscal Policy Institute estimates that 48,000 of the 80,000 jobs that New York City will have lost by the end of the year pay an average of $23,000, significantly below the citywide average of about $58,000.
Another vulnerability of lower-income service workers is that they have fewer means of cushioning the blow than they had in prior recessions. Most have no savings and are deeper in debt than they were last time, because their inflation-adjusted earnings never really got off the ground in the 90's. The steady decline in higher-paying manufacturing jobs and an influx of low-skilled immigrants combined to keep wages down.
Government will be less helpful this time around. Safety nets are in tatters. Welfare-to-work programs made sense when work was plentiful, but without work, those no longer eligible for welfare have nowhere else to turn. Even job losers who still qualify will find that welfare payments in most states are worth less than before.
Unemployment insurance is also harder to get. Fewer than 30 percent of people who lose jobs now receive it, down from more than half several decades ago. Eligibility rules have grown steadily tighter. Since part-time workers, temps, the self-employed and people who have moved in and out of employment often don't qualify, a large portion of the lower-wage work force is excluded. Many who don't qualify are women with young children. 
Meanwhile, federal programs for job training and low-income housing have been shrunk by budget cuts. State and local governments are in no position to step in. They're already strapped by rapidly declining tax revenues. Rather than beefing up social services, they're starting to cut them.
In short, the fat years of the 90's have left us woefully unprepared for a deep recession that's likely to take a particularly large toll on the poor and lower-wage workers. Given all this, a "stimulus" plan like the one that passed last month in the House of Representatives and is being backed by the White House, which confers most of its benefits on large corporations and upper-income households, seems exactly the reverse of what's needed. Large corporations, already reeling from too much capacity, won't be induced to add more. Wealthier households, already spending whatever they want, won't be inspired to spend more. It's the bottom half who are in trouble. They're most likely to spend whatever extra they get. And they desperately need whatever government can supply. 
At a time of national crisis, when the nation must pull together, it seems only logical that we do what we can to avoid pulling further apart.

HEADLINE: In America; 
The Sadness Within

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
If you stay away from Ground Zero, which remains a landscape out of Dante, the city can seem pretty normal. The pre-Thanksgiving throngs in Midtown over the weekend were impressive. A gorgeous eight-ton, 81-foot Norway spruce is up and waiting for its Christmas decorations at Rockefeller Center.
 The weather for the most part has been sunny and crisp and there have been lines for discount theater tickets at the TKTS booth in Times Square. Tourism may be off, but getting a prime-time Saturday night reservation at one of the elite restaurants is as difficult as ever. 
 That's the surface picture.
Beneath the surface, the sorrow continues. The grief has not eased much, if at all, for the families of those killed at the World Trade Center. This will be the hardest of holiday seasons for them.
But the waves of hardship and sorrow have had an extraordinary reach, touching every neighborhood. New Yorkers, in varying degrees, remain both emotionally and economically shaken by the Trade Center attack and its aftermath. As many as 80,000 jobs will have been lost by the end of the year, most of them paying less than $25,000 annually. Onetime breadwinners are looking aghast at rent bills they can't pay, credit card obligations they can't meet, Christmas presents they won't be able to buy.
An article in The Times last Tuesday said: "The terrorists who attacked the World Trade Center may have been trying to crush American capitalism and its masters of the universe on Wall Street. But the economic impact of the attack is felling a very different group of people: cooks, cabdrivers, sales clerks and seamstresses."
Among those witnessing this disaster close up are the staff members of Safe Horizon, a victims' services organization that is offering financial assistance and counseling to people affected by the Trade Center attack, including displaced workers and people who were forced from their homes.
"Initially we saw a lot of people who were just in shock, disbelief that this was happening," said Nancy Arnow, a Safe Horizon vice president for family and clinical programs.
After several weeks, she said, the initial anxiety and fear began to be accompanied by increasing anger as the Trade Center attack was followed by the anthrax scares, bomb threats and other traumatic developments.
Nervous workers were finding it difficult in some cases to ride the subways or go into tall buildings, making it difficult to get to work. Absences have increased. Safe Horizon and other groups have reported that friction at work, particularly between employees and supervisors, has also increased. The looming threat of layoffs has not helped.
The more immediate fears are being faced by people who have already lost their jobs. Safe Horizon's Christa Stewart said she and other staff members are seeing hundreds of newly unemployed men and women every day, most of them from Lower Manhattan. "The range has been very striking in terms of the economic base they're coming from," she said. "We're seeing attorneys who worked in the area. We see the pushcart vendors. We see a lot of restaurant workers."
Some have savings to fall back on, but most don't. Many are frightened and depressed. They show up at Safe Horizon with stacks of bills and blurt out -- sometimes with tears in their eyes -- that they have no idea how they'll be able to pay them.
For many of the displaced workers, according to another Safe Horizon staff member, Christy Gibney, "There's really no end in sight to the devastation. It's frustrating for us to be working with them knowing that we are only giving them this immediate help to get them through the next couple of weeks, or the next month or two. The long-term issues are still there."
The holidays are coming and New York will put the best possible face on them. But there's a difference between normalcy and the appearance of normalcy. To the extent that there's an emotional thread running through all the days since Sept. 11, I would say that it's a deep sense of sadness that is felt by nearly all New Yorkers, certainly for the tremendous loss of life, but also for the gruesome physical damage downtown, and for the loss -- at least temporarily -- of that sense of security and confidence, the swagger, that contributed so much to the essence of New York, and thus was so meaningful to so many.

HEADLINE: With Rangers Diverted to Security, Parks Feel the Strain 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: MUIR WOODS NATIONAL MONUMENT, Calif., Nov. 11 

 BODY:
The already overburdened resources of the National Park Service have been stretched even further since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, with hundreds of federal rangers reassigned to security details and many state parks even harder pressed as local law enforcement officers investigate anthrax scares.
 At the same time, parks near large cities have experienced an average 15 percent increase in attendance, a Park Service spokesman, David Barna, said.said. 
 At Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, about 60 miles from Washington, attendance jumped 39 percent in September, he said. Attendance at Yosemite National Park, in California, was up about 10 percent. 
"People are going back to the parks to get away from the news," Mr. Barna said. "They are those special places we set aside for solace, for reflection."
The park service prepared for a surge of visitors over Veterans Day weekend after offering free admission to promote "unity, hope and healing."
"This is not about money," Mr. Barna said. "It's not significant enough compared to the significance of helping this country heal. We all have families. We're all in this together. We're not counting dollars this weekend."
Not all parks have seen higher attendance since Sept. 11. Tourism has been hurt at places like the Grand Canyon and the Muir Woods, which depend to a large extent on air travel and foreign visitors. Fully 78 percent of the 1.8 million people a year who visit the Muir Woods, a forest of towering redwoods in a hidden valley just north of San Francisco, are visiting from outside the Bay Area, and 22 percent are foreign tourists, the park said.
John and Betty Parker of Concord, Calif., took their nieces, visiting from Canton, Ohio, to the park on Friday.
With many tourists suffering from post-attack jitters, Mr. Parker said all the popular spots have seemed less busy than usual.
"We walked across the Golden Gate Bridge on Wednesday and no one was there," he said. "This is a perfect time for people to get out."
B. J. Ray, his wife, Rainey, and their two friends decided to take advantage of low air fares from Dallas and celebrate their wedding anniversaries with a trip to San Francisco.
"There's definitely been a mentality that we're not going to live in fear," Mr. Ray said.
The suspension of park entrance fees through Monday should provide an economic lift to businesses in and around parks.
State parks in California and at least 25 other states also waived admission fees.
"There are certain parks where people will flock to if the fees are dropped," said Roy Stearns, California's deputy parks director.
National parks expect to break even this weekend, reasoning that the money visitors do not spend on entrance fees will probably be spent at concession stands, gift shops and visitors' centers.
California's parks expect to lose less than $100,000, Mr. Stearns said.
"When you think of the honor we can pay to veterans, I think that far outweighs the money loss," Mr. Stearns said. "We may take a little hit, but I think the communities around those parks will feel the benefits."
About a third of the nation's parks charge admission fees, adding up to $145 million a year. Since 1996, that money has gone directly back into the park system for much-needed maintenance and repairs, Mr. Barna said.
There is a $4.9 billion maintenance backlog, which President Bush has proposed to eliminate in five years with additional money.
Annually, the service spends $2.5 billion on 385 parks, which, last year, had 287 million visitors.
Since Sept. 11, about 200 park employees have been reassigned to homeland security. Park rangers are patrolling dams in the West, parks near the Canadian and Mexican borders and major monuments in the Washington area. A handful are alsogetting sky marshal training, Mr. Barna said.
The service's 200 seasonal law enforcement employees, who work primarily in the summer, have been asked back to the parks to help compensate for the loss.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LIABILITY; 
Daschle Seeks Compromise On Aid Plan For Insurers

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
Striving to break a political logjam before the Senate adjourns, Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, will try this week to forge a compromise to offer financial assistance to insurers for any more large terrorist attacks, his colleagues say.
 In the House of Representatives, meanwhile, lawmakers expect to move a bill with a different approach to the floor soon. The House bill would provide billions of dollars in loans to the insurers to cover losses from any large attacks next year, but the White House has instead proposed direct assistance. 
 The House made significant progress on a bill last week when the House Financial Services Committee approved a measure by voice vote. The bill would generally provide loans to the industry to cover 90 percent of the costs for attacks with damages greater than $1 billion. For attacks causing more than $20 billion in losses, the bill would impose a special assessment on insurance policyholders to help defray costs. It would also offer tax breaks to the industry so it could build reserves for future attacks. 
But the Senate has been unable to get a bill out of committee. Lawmakers say Senator Daschle plans discussions this week with the heads of three committees -- on banking, commerce and the judiciary -- that have stalled progress on a measure because of a jurisdictional squabble.
For weeks, lawmakers and the administration have struggled to write a law that would provide aid to the insurance industry for any more large attacks. While a broad consensus has emerged about the need for legislation, sharp disagreement remains about its contours. 
Executives from the insurance industry and other sectors have said that lenders would be reluctant to finance real estate and manufacturing projects if new policies no longer protect against terrorism losses. Administration officials have predicted an economic crisis if Congress fails to act before it adjourns, which is expected soon.
Lawmakers agree that they must encourage insurers to continue to offer reasonable coverage for terrorism, but disagree about how the federal government, which has never regulated the industry, can do that. 
The debate in Congress has centered on these four points: How much should insurers be required to pay before the government intervenes? Should the insurers have to pay back any government assistance? What steps should the federal government take to require insurers to continue to provide reasonably priced coverage for vulnerable properties, like the Empire State Building and the Sears Tower, and for distressed areas, like Lower Manhattan, that have found it difficult to get insurance? Should a measure limit the legal liability of the insurers in terrorist attacks -- perhaps by restricting punitive damages, as the administration is demanding -- or should it leave the nation's tort law system unchanged, as some leading Democrats have urged?
An earlier plan proposed by the chairman and ranking Republican on the Senate banking committee and endorsed by the administration has stalled because of limits on the insurers' legal liability. Some lawmakers also criticize it for failing to protect smaller insurance companies from significant losses.
A compromise that would drop the legal liability protections and meld provisions from House and Senate bills will be filed this week by two Democrats on the Senate banking committee, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York and Senator Jon Corzine of New Jersey.
Their measure would generally require the industry to pay $10 billion in claims before the government would intervene. For incidents costing $10 billion to $30 billion, the government would provide financial assistance of 80 percent, to be repaid through a special assessment on the insurers. For attacks costing more than $30 billion, the industry would not have to repay the 80 percent paid by the government. The bill protects smaller insurers by capping any individual company's liability at 5 percent of its premiums.
"There's gridlock and all sorts of cross-cutting disputes," Mr. Schumer said. "We try to come to a happy medium."
Mr. Corzine said the legislation tried to overcome a number of political and ideological obstacles, including changes in tort law. He said it was important to make sure that vulnerable properties could get reasonable insurance coverage. "It's crucial to have that risk covered, or you will have huge exposures that I don't think banks or the bond market will tolerate at a reasonable price" in financing projects, said Mr. Corzine, a former chief executive of Goldman, Sachs.

HEADLINE: Mental Health, on Equal Terms 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The World Trade Center tragedy ushered in understanding for the crippling symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and highlighted the urgent need for access to quality mental health clinicians. Such overdue recognition has now backfired and mobilized opposition to parity, which would broaden access to service (front page, Nov. 6). 
 People who battle severe psychiatric symptoms must also fight this pervasive discrimination and archaic stigma. The opposition to parity defies our surgeon general, who has advocated for more diagnosis and treatment, and the economics that has demonstrated that any modest cost is offset by increased productivity and decreased absenteeism. 
 If we substituted heart disease, cancer, diabetes or hypertension for mental illness, would we defer diagnosis and treatment of such diseases to the insurance lobby?

HEADLINE: DONATIONS; 
A Company Scrambles to Keep Its 'Strategic Philanthropy' Going

BYLINE:  By DANIEL GROSS 

 BODY:
IN 1984, American Express revolutionized corporate philanthropy when it introduced a highly successful campaign to restore the Statue of Liberty. The company offered to donate 1 cent from every charge made on its cards over a three-month period to help rebuild and restore the statue. The campaign raised $1.7 million and encouraged customers to pull out their cards to make purchases. During the campaign, card use rose 28 percent compared with the same period a year before.
 Aligning business campaigns with nonprofit ventures has become known as cause-related marketing. The idea is to enlist consumers in a philanthropic effort by using a company's services. 
 Such efforts can help worthy causes, bolster business and spruce up a company's image.
Cause-related marketing is also a staple of "strategic philanthropy," in which executives of corporate foundations work closely with their colleagues on the business side of the company. 
"Corporations have recognized that their philanthropy should be as strategic as all of their business operating programs," said Carole Cone, a strategic philanthropy consultant in Boston.
Because large corporations like American Express have aligned themselves with philanthropies, there were expectations after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that the business world would help with the relief efforts. Initially, their response involved donations of cash and services. Then, American Express and other companies found ways of responding through strategic philanthropy.
For American Express, the challenge was complicated by the company's own circumstances. The foundation's headquarters were on the 48th floor of the World Financial Center, a block west of the World Trade Center. When the staff evacuated its offices on Sept. 11, several checks for nonprofit groups were left behind. 
"We had just cut checks to several of our grantees, and we had no way to retrieve them," said Mary Beth Salerno, the president of the American Express Foundation. "So, we made lists from memory and began contacting our grantees to assure them they would receive their grants as soon as possible."
Every year, the American Express Foundation makes about $30 million in grants to a range of nonprofit groups, many of which indirectly help promote the company's services. About a third of the foundation's grants support cultural heritage projects around the world; many of these promote travel and tourism. 
For example, the company has given $10 million over the last decade to the World Monuments Fund, which tries to protect endangered works of art and architecture. The foundation also supports financial literacy programs.
In the aftermath of the attacks, Ms. Salerno and her staff helped to shape the company's philanthropic response. Like other large companies, American Express's immediate reaction was to donate cash. On the morning of Sept. 13, the company's executives committed initial grants of $250,000 each to the Red Cross and to the newly formed September 11 Fund. 
The company announced that it would give $1 million to the families of its 11 employees who were lost at the World Trade Center. And the American Express Foundation set aside $1 million to create and administer a disaster relief fund. 
Then came Part 2. "The cash and supplies were the first wave, and now there is a second wave, dealing with other issues not as immediate or obvious," said Bradley Googgins, the executive director of the Center for Corporate Citizenship at Boston College. 
One of the company's first decisions was to use philanthropy to cement bonds with employees. American Express wanted to acknowledge that employees were deeply affected by the events of Sept. 11. 
A WEEK after the attacks, the company held a rally at Madison Square Garden for 5,000 employees. At the rally, the company announced that its relief fund would be part of the employees' giving campaign. The company promised to match donations made to the fund by retirees, financial advisers and employees. 
"We don't usually collect money at the foundation, but we opened it up to allow employees to contribute," Ms. Salerno said. So far, employees have pledged $1 million.
Then, foundation and business executives worked together to redirect cause-related marketing programs. Those campaigns are run by the business side of the company, but its executives frequently turn to Ms. Salerno for advice. 
"Our role in many of these is to be advisory, to help with contacts," she said. 
American Express helped to reschedule Restaurant Week, which encourages cardholders to patronize New York City restaurants that offer $20.01 lunch specials. After the attack, the event was moved to Oct. 15 instead of January and was extended to two weeks from one. 
The company also used advertising to remind diners that Lower Manhattan restaurants had reopened.
"We ran newspaper ads noting that the lights are on, and now the customers need to come," said Steve Squeri, the president of the company's establishment services division for the United States and Canada, which handles relationships with businesses that accept the card.
Another company campaign, Membership Rewards, was also tweaked. That program allows cardholders to accumulate points and redeem them for travel certificates, merchandise and donations to groups like United Cerebral Palsy and the Special Olympics. American Express added Sept. 11 relief groups to its list of eligible charities and offered to match 2001 donations to all charities, up to $200,000 over all. 
A result: "We have had a 250 percent increase in redemptions for charities since Sept. 11," said Susan Sobbott, the company's senior vice president for loyalty rewards and alliance development.
The question now is how long the outpouring of generosity can last. In the months before the attacks, American Express laid off 6,100 employees as its stock price plunged. The company is now facing an even tougher business climate. Late last month, it reported that quarterly earnings fell 60 percent, while travel sales fell 28 percent from the year before.
In an economic downturn, will corporations like American Express continue to finance both relief efforts and other commitments to nonprofit groups?
"If these large donations come out of existing budgets, then something has to give," said Curt Weeden, the chief executive of the Contributions Academy in Charleston, S.C., and a former vice president of corporate contributions at Johnson & Johnson. "If something else happens, are those deep pockets still going to be there?"
Ms. Salerno said that American Express was making contributions to the relief fund partly from discretionary money.
"I think it is important to not just take a 180-degree turn from other things that we're doing," she said. "A lot of nonprofits, in New York and elsewhere, were having a difficult time before Sept. 11."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ATOMIC ENERGY; 
Lax Nuclear Security in Russia Is Cited as Way for bin Laden to Get Arms

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
In the last year, there have been dozens of violations of nuclear security rules in Russia and at least one loss of fissile material; Taliban emissaries have tried to recruit Russian scientists, and terrorists have tried to stake out a Russian nuclear storage site at least twice, say senior officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency and Western governments.
 The officials detailed the incidents, citing conversations with Russian officials and verified news reports. Despite significant improvements in Russian nuclear security in the 1990's -- some of it with American money and advice -- up to half of ex-Soviet civilian and military nuclear stockpiles with weapons-grade material are not well protected. 
 Officials of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations body for monitoring nuclear programs, are deeply skeptical of Osama bin Laden's claim, in an interview published in Pakistan on Friday, that he possesses nuclear weapons.
On the other hand, given the vulnerability of material in the former Soviet Union, the increasing professionalism of nuclear smuggling and the relative ease of fabricating a primitive weapon, they cannot rule it out. 
In the Kazakh port of Aktau on the Caspian shore, one ton of plutonium and two tons of highly enriched uranium sit near a now closed breeder reactor.
Ukraine, with 17 nuclear reactors and one research reactor, is considered a country of "serious concern" by officials because of its climate of government corruption and crime. Enough highly enriched uranium to make a bomb remains at a research reactor just outside Belgrade throughout the 1999 Kosovo war.
Just last week, Turkey announced it had broken up a gang of smugglers who tried to sell 2.2 pounds of what appeared to be highly enriched uranium for $750,000 to undercover police officers, material they said they had bought several months ago from a Russian of Azeri origin.
Officials are increasingly concerned that terrorists willing to die could create a "dirty bomb," wrapping more easily stolen radioactive materials used in medicine and industry around a conventional explosive, like dynamite, to try to make a significant area of a city uninhabitable for many years.
Russian officials say their fissile nuclear material is under strict and improving controls. But only 10 days ago, in a discussion with officials at the United Nations agency here, Yuri G. Volodin, chief of safeguards for the Russian nuclear regulatory agency, revealed that in the last year, there were dozens of violations of Russia's regulations for securing and accounting for nuclear material.
Mr. Volodin noted one loss of nuclear material, which he called of the "highest consequence." He said he could not be more specific about the type of material or the size of the loss.
Last month, Col.-Gen. Igor Volynkin, head of nuclear security for Russia's military, said that twice this year Russian forces discovered stakeouts by terrorists of a secret nuclear arms storage facility, although he did not say where.
Also last month, an official of the Russian Security Council, Raisa Vdovichenko, told Russian journalists that emissaries of the Taliban had asked an employee of "an institution related to nuclear technologies to go to their country to work there in this field."
There is continuing evidence of efforts to traffic in nuclear material that give many officials deep concern. 
In April 2000, the police in Georgia seized, in Batumi, several hundred fast-reactor fuel pellets, containing 920 grams -- nearly a kilogram -- of highly enriched uranium; in September, at Tbilisi airport, the police confiscated half a gram of plutonium.
The Russians say they thwarted an effort, at the very end of 1998, by an organized gang to steal 18.5 kilograms -- more than 40 pounds -- of highly enriched uranium from a military weapons facility near Chelyabinsk in the Urals.
Still, senior officials here and in Washington do not believe that Mr. bin Laden or even any state interested in a shortcut to a bomb -- from Syria and Iran to Iraq and Libya -- has been able to obtain the roughly 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of highly enriched uranium required to make a simple bomb, or the roughly 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of plutonium, a much more difficult material with which to work.
But they also admit that they cannot possibly know for sure.
The atomic energy agency has built a database of incidents of nuclear trafficking since 1993 -- only counting incidents confirmed by the states involved. Of the 175 cases of trafficking in nuclear material and 201 cases of trafficking in medical and industrial radioactive materials, only some 18 cases involved even small amounts of the fissionable material needed for a nuclear bomb -- plutonium or highly enriched uranium (enriched by 20 percent or more).
Altogether in all these cases, agency officials say, there have been seizures of about 400 grams (nearly one pound) of plutonium and an additional 12 kilograms (26.4 pounds) of uranium at varying levels of enrichment, equivalent to only some 6 kilograms of uranium 235.
The most serious cases, involving large amounts of material, took place in 1993 and 1994, when Russian, German and Czech police officers made large seizures of very highly enriched nuclear material manufactured in the former Soviet Union, usually at nuclear-fuel fabrication plants.
In March 1993, in St. Petersburg, nearly three kilograms (6.6 pounds) of 90 percent enriched uranium-238 were seized; in August 1994, in Munich, the police seized about 360 grams of Russian-made plutonium; in December 1994, 2.7 kilograms (just over 5 pounds) of 80 percent enriched uranium-235 were seized, part of a shipment that showed up in smaller amounts in other places -- and which officials hope was not part of an even larger shipment, apparently stolen from the Russian nuclear research center in Obninsk, about an hour's drive southwest of Moscow.
For context, officials point out, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had made only 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) of bomb-capable uranium before the gulf war broke out.
But in fact the atomic energy agency's database is only a guide, and perhaps not even a good one. "Are we seeing half the iceberg or only the tip?" said one official, noting that the police consider seizures of drugs, a commodity far easier to secure, to represent only some 10 to 20 percent of what is shipped. Nor does the agency, devoted to civilian nuclear energy, know much about the military programs of states with nuclear weapons.
Friedrich Steinhausler, a physics professor at Stanford University and co-director of a Stanford center on the physical protection of nuclear materials, said, "It's clear that we're seeing a typical move toward professionalism in this smuggling business, with increasingly fewer incidents of significance, but of greater significance, as professionals are probing the market."
He noted that traffickers increasingly are going south, over traditional smuggling routes through Turkey, the Caucasus and especially central Asia, closer to Afghanistan, where borders are extremely long and lax. 
Matthew Bunn, assistant director of the science, technology and public policy program at Harvard University's Kennedy School, was a Clinton White House adviser. The main source of loose nuclear material remains the former Soviet Union, he says, with some 600 tons of weapons-grade nuclear material stored there outside of warheads.
The key question, he says, is to improve the security around military and especially civilian nuclear installations. In as many as half, he said, there are no automatic detectors that sound an alarm if material is smuggled out, and no security cameras where material is stored.
"For all the work we've done with Russia, after seven years, we still have most of the job to do," Mr. Bunn said. "This is a serious threat, and we know how to fix it," he said, urging that President Bush agree with Russia at the this week's summit meeting to account for and secure all nuclear material.
Some safeguards put in place by the Americans in the former Soviet Union no longer function, agency officials said -- spare parts are expensive and available only from the United States, and sometimes guards do not bother to use the equipment.
The Vienna agency is also looking for a 10 percent increase in its own budget of some $320 million, said Graham Andrew, the special assistant for Scientific and Technical Affairs, to upgrade security standards around the world. He and other officials regard a terrorist nuclear bomb to be "highly unlikely."
But the likelihood of terrorists compiling the radioactive materials necessary to make a dirty bomb with immense economic and psychological impact is much higher, the officials say.
The dirty bomb is an almost ideal instrument of terror, Mr. Bunn said. It would not kill many people, but it would terrify, and make a large area unsafe to work or live in, possibly for decades or longer. 
One official said: "Imagine a dirty bomb on the Washington mall. Do you abandon the White House?"

HEADLINE: Democrats Contend a Pataki Lobbyist Has a Conflict 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
A longtime Republican associate of Gov. George E. Pataki has found himself playing a dual role in recent days, at times lobbying Congress on the governor's behalf, at others representing American Indians in negotiations with Mr. Pataki.
 On the one hand, the lobbyist, Bill Paxon, a former Republican congressman from western New York, has been hired by the Seneca Nation of Indians, along with three other members of his law firm, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, to negotiate a contract with the state for three casinos in the Buffalo area. 
 On the other, Mr. Paxon has been prowling the corners of the Capitol at the governor's request, helping -- informally and free of charge -- to persuade Congress to grant Mr. Pataki's request for $54 billion to help rebuild New York's economy after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. 
"He's one New Yorker who's helping us out," the governor's spokesman, Michael McKeon, said. "We are going to call on any and all New Yorkers to help us out."
But Mr. Paxon's dual role has drawn criticism from some Democrats and advocates for open government, who maintain that his favors for Mr. Pataki in Washington cast doubt on whether the governor's negotiations with the Seneca Indians are at arm's length.
Mr. Paxon maintains he has been urging key members of Congress and their staff to support the governor's request for more aid because of his deep roots in New York, not because he expects any favors from Mr. Pataki. It is, he said, a labor of love.
Mr. McKeon said that Mr. Pataki himself was taking the lead role in lobbying Congress, and that Mr. Paxon's informal help would have no bearing on the casino negotiations.
Mr. Paxon lobbied the State Legislature earlier this year to pass a law giving Mr. Pataki the ability to negotiate a pact with the Seneca Indians. He said he has not been at the table for substantive negotiations with the governor's office over the compact itself, though others in his firm have. "It's been a hard-fought negotiation," he said.
The Seneca tribe hired Akin, Gump in late December 2000, members of the firm and the tribe said. 
Besides Mr. Paxon, the firm dispatched Donald R. Pongrace, an expert on Native American legal affairs, and Barry W. Brandon, a Seneca Indian who has expertise in gaming law and is a former Justice Department lawyer, to New York to hammer out a framework for an agreement with Mr. Pataki s office. 
Mr. Paxon and Anthony P. Foti, a former Republican aide to the Assembly minority leader, were added to the team because of their knowledge of the state's politics. "My role was to add some of the political direction to the team," Mr. Paxon said.
According to state lobbying records, Mr. Paxon's firm has been paid $344,000 by the Seneca tribe since January.
For the state, negotiations have been handled by Patrick Kehoe, an assistant counsel in the governor's office, and John O'Mara, a former judge from Elmira. Mr. O'Mara is an influential Republican fund-raiser with close ties to Mr. Pataki. The state has paid his firm $23,000 for its work negotiating with the Senecas, state records show.
Earlier this year, Mr. Paxon's firm also received a $600,000 lobbying contract from the State University of New York to seek more federal financing for state colleges, university officials said. As a practical matter, Mr. Pataki's appointees control the university's board. SUNY's chancellor, Robert L. King, was a senior aide to the governor and served as state budget director before taking over the university system.
But a SUNY spokesman, David Henahan, said the trustees had chosen Akin, Gump for "the strength of the firm, not just one individual."
Mr. Pataki, Mr. King and Mr. Paxon were all members of the Assembly's Republican minority during the 1980's. In June, Akin, Gump firm hired another influential Assembly Republican from that era, Clarence D. Rappleyea, to lobby state lawmakers on the Senecas' behalf. He is paid $10,000 a month, state lobby records show. Mr. Rappleyea also has close ties to Mr. Pataki, who appointed him to head the New York Power Authority. He recently stepped down to become a lobbyist. 
Several Democratic lawmakers said Mr. Paxon had a conflict of interest. They pointed out that Mr. King, a former Pataki administration insider, had given Mr. Paxon's firm a lucrative contract at the same time Mr. Paxon was lobbying Mr. Pataki on behalf of the Senecas.
In addition, the free work in Washington that Mr. Paxon has done for the governor leaves Mr. Pataki in his debt at a time when the governor is supposed to be holding arm-length negotiations with the Senecas, who also have land claims pending against the state, these critics said.
State Senator Richard A. Dollinger, a Rochester Democrat, said the arrangement blurred ethical distinctions so much that they were nearly hidden. But he said they still existed. "They are involved in a dispute with the state of New York," he said referring to Akin, Gump's work for the Senecas. "I don't see how they can be out there lobbying on behalf of the state of New York."
Advocates for open government also questioned the governor's decision to enlist the help of Mr. Paxon while Mr. Paxon was working for the Senecas. "It's hard to say you are at the table for one conversation but not at the table for another," the executive director of Common Cause in New York, Rachel Leon, said. "Hiring lobbyists that at the same time are lobbying them on other issues just doesn't cut it."
But Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at New York University Law School, said Mr. Paxon had violated neither the American Bar Association's code of professional conduct nor the New York Bar Association's professional rules. Those codes would prohibit Mr. Paxon only from lobbying on the governor's behalf while working in opposition to the state, representing, for instance, someone suing the state.
"Lobbying the governor is not seen as opposing the state," Professor Gillers said.
He added, though, that scholars disagree about whether lawyers negotiating a contract with the governor's office can be considered in inherent opposition to the state. "It's a muddy area," Mr. Gillers said. "In the view of some lawyers and ethics committees, negotiating against a current client, even if it's a friendly negotiation, is a conflict, unless the client consents to the activity."

Like Other Monthlies, Esquire Dances to a New Rhythm

BYLINE:  By DAVID HANDELMAN 

 BODY:
On Sept. 11, David Granger, the editor in chief of Esquire, was about to ship the last few pages of his November issue when terrorists attacked America. Staring at a mockup of the cover -- a photo of the actress Cameron Diaz -- Mr. Granger knew that three weeks later, when the issue reached newsstands and mailboxes, it would seem "wrong," he said, "that Esquire would be represented to the world by that cover."
 Mr. Granger faced the same challenge as all his peers editing monthly general-interest magazines. With life changing underfoot, and an unwieldy lead time (three weeks between finishing the pages and distributing the issues), he needed to be somehow newsworthy and a must-read. 
 His short-term plan was swift and sure. For November, Mr. Granger rewrote his editor's letter and shelved the Diaz cover and eight-page profile. Instead, he ran photographs by Patricia McDonough of the World Trade Center burning outside her Battery Park apartment window; first-person articles by two war correspondents, Scott Anderson and John Falk; and an essay about the imminent war by Walter Russell Mead, the policy expert. A new cover depicted the towers exploding in the pupil of an enlarged eye, headlined, "What They Saw."
Yet those stories were jarringly juxtaposed with previously shipped features about bacon, corduroy and the best ways to photograph celebrities. And soon, Mr. Granger faced a bigger, more complex problem: what to do the next month, and the ones after that, with a war under way and signs of biological warfare dominating newspapers, television, weeklies and the Internet. Other monthly editors are also wrestling with the difficulty of forecasting events and moods.
"I've been a magazine editor for a long time," said Mr. Granger's colleague, Ellen Levine, editor in chief of Good Housekeeping, which, like Esquire, is owned by the Hearst Corporation, "but I'm not used to editing in the age of anthrax, with this kind of psychological uncertainty in the country. Anticipating whether two months from now, people will want something totally escapist or totally relevant is impossible."
Since taking over Esquire in June 1997, Mr. Granger had run a provocative, inventive, sometimes overreaching magazine, publishing some powerful long-form journalism, as well as some less successful experiments, like the profile of the singer Michael Stipe, which uneasily blended fact and fiction. In the wake of Sept. 11, Mr. Granger felt forced to re-examine his vision, trying to calculate how many stories should reflect Topic A, and which others needed to be rethought or jettisoned.
"As opposed to the newsweeklies or the New Yorker, we can't cover the war," Mr. Granger said in an interview. "I'm not going to run anthrax covers, because three weeks from now, who knows, it may be smallpox." Instead, he said, "our role is to do a great magazine." For him, that means dispensing with what he calls "curiosities -- like, 'Oh, well, that's interesting.' "
He cited articles that had been planned about a ventriloquists' convention and about a psychology guru who coaches men "how to be less nice,' which are now in limbo. "Stories need to seem necessary," he said. 
The same holds true for Mr. Granger's primary competitor, Advance Publications' GQ. After Sept. 11, the editor in chief, Art Cooper, canceled articles on feral surfing in Indonesia and the last of the Nazi hunters.
"It just seemed like octagenarian Nazis are not much of a threat any more," Mr. Cooper said. Most readers do not understand publishing schedules, he said, noting that he had been misguidedly complimented by many people for publishing a divertingly off-topic sports issue in October, which came out on Sept. 18.
Meanwhile, he said, he was "going crazy" because the magazine had nothing about Sept. 11.
In November, Mr. Cooper compensated with a 14-page package, including an article by Jeff Greenfield, the CNN commentator, and an interview (conducted in 1996 and 1997) by Robert Fisk with Osama Bin Laden, but he did not alter the annual Men of the Year cover. In the December issue, with Will Smith on the cover, the magazine will begin a monthly column called "The Shadow War" by a former F.B.I. special agent, Christopher Whitcomb. In addition, it will have a previously planned article on a plot to blow up Los Angeles International Airport, and a humor article by Joe Queenan on unemployment among ironists. Mr. Cooper said he planned to devote two of each month's six main articles to the new world order for the foreseeable future.
The women's magazines also feel a need to relate current events to readers' lives. At More, a publication of the Meredith Corporation, the editor in chief, Myrna Blyth, commissioned an interview with a Bush adviser, Karen Hughes, and replaced a Christmas story called "50 Glittering Gifts" with one called "50 Ways to Give Back."
"We're certainly going to keep writing about this event," Ms. Blyth said, "but it's hard to give specific information three months later that hasn't been in the newspaper."
In Esquire's December issue, Mr. Granger will have a long-planned article by Mike Sager about a marine, which was written as the life of a professional soldier in peacetime. After Sept. 11, the marine was sent off to battle, and Mr. Sager updated the article, transforming it, in Mr. Granger's words, from "kind of a nice profile to a great look at an American figure, the kind of person who is going to wage war for us."
The issue also contains a recently commissioned article by Charles Pierce called "162 Reasons It's Good to Be an American Man." The reasons include Hawaiian Punch, the mirror scene in Duck Soup and skyscrapers. "Before Sept. 11, I might not have run it. It would have seemed hokey," Mr. Granger said. "But given what we lost, the things we have seem more precious." 
But the issue also contains the magazine's annual survey of the best new American restaurants, and a cover article in which the stars of "Ocean's 11," Julia Roberts and George Clooney, interview each other. 
"An equally important part of my mission is to entertain and delight," Mr. Granger said. "When somebody puts the magazine down, they should be looking forward to the next issue."
The January issue has short interviews with notable men, called "The Meaning of Life: Good Advice for Challenging Times." Among the subjects are one of the inventors of the hydrogen bomb, Edward Teller, and a man who climbed up from under the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.
The February cover story, Mr. Granger says, will profile "two of the most important people in our war effort. But at most, I'm going to have opportunities like that once a month, and I've got 100 pages to fill."

Recipe for Roasting the Sacred Cow, Tastelessly

BYLINE:  By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
In its first post-Sept. 11 issue, the satirical magazine Private Eye included a clip-out cancellation form for infuriated readers. This was a wise move.
 For starters, the cover that week showed the now-famous photograph of President Bush learning about the World Trade Center attack. Under the headline "Bush Takes Charge," the president and his aide were having a little annotated exchange, sotto voce. 
 Aide: "It's Armageddon, sir."
Bush: "Armageddon outahere!"
Hundreds of cancellations duly ensued, along with the by-now-familiar complement of outraged letters, one of which denounced Private Eye as a "silly, misinformed, poisonous little rag." Be that as it may, such outrage does not remotely discomfit Private Eye's unapologetic editor, Ian Hislop, who feels that at times of unified national piety, Britain needs his magazine's brand of irreverence more than ever. 
Private Eye turned 40 this fall, and it is fitting that, once again, it is embroiled in a furor about the limits of taste in times of tragedy. It has been here before.
In 1991, when the unscrupulous media magnate Robert Maxwell drowned, the magazine devoted its cover to his funeral, with the headline "Here lies Robert Maxwell." Down below, it wrote: "He lied everywhere else."
Six years later, when the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales, provoked a spontaneous effusion of rage at the news media -- even as Britons bought more newspapers than ever -- the cover showed a photograph of grieving crowds descending on Buckingham Palace.
"The papers are a disgrace," one mourner was saying.
"Yes, I couldn't get one anywhere," answered another. 
In many respects, the magazine has changed little in the last four decades. It still resembles a college gossip sheet. It still defines its mission as taking on the powerful and the influential, the famous and the puffed-up, and it still seeks to wrestle to the ground things it finds hypocritical, ridiculous and sycophantic, particularly in the government and the news media.
At a time when Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government has virtually neutered its political opposition, Private Eye often has an important, if mischievous and sometimes borderline, role in taking on Mr. Blair.
"I'm all for bad taste if you can justify its making a point," said Mr. Hislop cheerfully. "Merely saying, 'Guess what, some people have died,' is not funny. But jokes arising, for instance, from the lunacy of what's happened since Sept. 11, are."
Britain has had publications of this sort for a long time. "Private Eye is in a long English tradition of satirical journalism," Mr. Hislop said. "The 18th-century journals exposed vice, folly and humbug, and we're in that tradition, to tell the truth smilingly, to question the official view. It's fantastically useful in democracies to have someone saying No."
It often works, said Roy Greenslade, who writes a column about the news media for the liberal-leaning Guardian.
"I always think of it as the court jester, and the great thing the court jester was able to do was to dress up serious things in such an amusing fashion that the king laughed rather than cried," Mr. Greenslade said. "But the king also received messages from the jester that no one else dared tell him." Private Eye's humor is very English and very public school, meaning that it is full of puns, unkind nicknames and relentless parody, and it can veer dizzyingly between the funny and the puerile. The magazine, put out every other week in a cramped Soho office by a ragtag group of staff members and hangers-on, is an equal-opportunity criticizer, carpet-bombing the British establishment and sometimes causing collateral damage.
Its targets range from Mr. Blair, who has been recast as a more-pious-than-thou vicar, to the London police force, whose officers last year shot and killed several unarmed people. Other targets are media figures like Piers Morgan, the editor of The Daily Mirror, a scrappy tabloid. Even Mr. Greenslade, the media commentator, has a Private Eye nickname, Roy Greenslime. 
Mr. Morgan declined to comment about Private Eye's tendency to call him Piers Moron. 
Along the way, the magazine sends up newspapers' habit of printing space-filling features -- unlike this one -- about practically nothing; the tendency of important novelists to think very highly of their own glaringly obvious opinions; the tendency of doctors to make mistakes and then try to cover them up; and the tendency of public officials to say stupid things. 
The Eye's regular news columns, written anonymously by aggrieved whistle-blowers in medicine, farming, business and the like, occasionally break new ground. The magazine was the first to print allegations about what became a full-fledged malpractice scandal in the pediatric cardiac department at a hospital in Bristol. 
Printed on cheap paper and with production standards it keeps low because of the $360,000 a year it spends to defend itself against frequent libel suits, the magazine manages to sell a healthy 180,000 copies or so an issue. But it is no Economist, caring particularly for accuracy. Its biggest fault, perhaps, is its reliance on that legendary British journalistic staple: the fact too good to check. 
While acknowledging that the Eye is not as strict as it might be -- "The American system, where you have fact checkers ringing up and saying, 'Is Paris really in France?' is completely alien to us," Mr. Hislop said -- the editor added that when it counts, the magazine gets it right.
"If you put the boot into someone and they were innocent and we were wrong, then I do feel bad, rightly," he said. "But I never regret going after the big guys."

HEADLINE: Bush and Putin Expected to Agree to Reduce Nuclear Arsenals and to Fight Terrorism 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

 BODY:
President Bush will hold a summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia this week and will try to close a number of agreements that could profoundly change the post-cold-war trajectory of relations between Washington and Moscow.
 Meeting against a backdrop of war in Afghanistan and the national mobilization against terror at home, the two leaders are expected to announce deep reductions in the offensive nuclear arsenals that have stood -- needlessly in the view of much of the world -- like overhanging threats from the era of superpower competition. 
 The two men are also poised to establish a strong bond of cooperation -- perhaps an alliance of sorts -- in the struggle to quell the Islamic violence that has been welling up in Central Asia. The movements there directly threaten Russia's security and that of former Soviet republics that are striving -- many with American investment -- to tap one of the last great reservoirs of oil and natural gas on the planet. 
Mr. Putin has also telegraphed that he is ready to reach an accord that will allow the United States to proceed with rigorous testing of antiballistic missile systems as long as Mr. Bush will agree to preserve the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which Russia sees as the cornerstone of strategic stability.
To critics who say that Russia has nothing to offer the United States, Mr. Putin has broadcast in a number of pre-summit-meeting interviews that Russia, the world's second-largest oil producer, stands ready to ensure the West's energy security in the event of war or disruption in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.
A number of American leaders have been impressed. 
"Russia has a tremendous capacity of being an alternate energy source for the United States," Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said last week.
Russia's churlish intelligence services have -- under orders from the Kremlin -- unloaded into American hands an inestimable amount of information about the networks that radiate out from Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network into the Middle East and Asia. 
"This is a very different relationship now," said Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, in briefing reporters last week. "This is a different relationship than the one that Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon had, or even that George Herbert Walker Bush and Gorbachev had," she said. "It is a relationship that got new impetus to shared cooperative security issues concerning Sept. 11 and counterterrorism," she added, and one that will be based on growing economic ties and an expanded role for Russia in the West's security. 
"I believe you will start to see the United States and NATO talk to Russia about how NATO and Russia can better relate," she said.
In Moscow, Kremlin officials told reporters this past weekend to expect as many as seven statements to emerge from the three-day meeting, which will begin in Washington tomorrow and carry over to Mr. Bush's Crawford, Tex., ranch on Wednesday and Thursday. The statements are likely to include one on the future of Afghanistan, an accord on joint efforts in counterterrorism, an agreement on missile defenses and reducing offensive weapons and an elaboration on Russia's role with NATO. 
In addition, administration officials in Washington said they were pushing for a "significant proliferation element" in any new strategic framework sealed with Russia, an apparent reference to its continuing sales to Iran of weapons and civilian nuclear reactor technology that the United States fears will assist Iran's quest to develop nuclear weapons.
Bush administration officials have sought to tamp down expectations that the meeting will produce significant results. But it has been increasingly apparent since Sept. 11 that both leaders view the attacks on the United States as a galvanizing event to overcome resistance to a new Russian-American partnership, broader even than the one forged by President Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin.
It was not so long ago that Mr. Bush himself was a factor in resisting Russia and Mr. Putin. The Bush administration came to office espousing the view that Russia did not account for much as a world power anymore. 
There is little agreement on what changed the course of Mr. Bush's thinking last spring. Some specialists have speculated that the confrontation with China over the collision of an American spy plane was a signal event that persuaded Mr. Bush and his advisers that their indifference to working collectively in foreign affairs was both alarming allies and driving other powers like China and Russia together. 
Mr. Bush sought to overcome these apprehensions with a European tour in June. In his first meeting with Mr. Putin, in Slovenia, Mr. Bush said that he had found in Mr. Putin a partner he could trust, a step that was essential if only to quiet the apprehension Mr. Bush had incited among European leaders about America going it alone on missile defense. Of Mr. Putin, Mr. Bush said, "I am convinced that he and I can build a relationship of mutual respect and candor." 
The sweep of events after Sept. 11 continues to impel the two leaders toward one another, notwithstanding the deep reservations many Americans harbor over Mr. Putin's background as a K.G.B. officer, whose political rise were orchestrated by Mr. Yeltsin and built on a brutal military campaign in Chechnya. 
In Shanghai last month, Mr. Bush, with some emotion, noted that his first call from a world leader after the Sept. 11 attacks came from Mr. Putin. Since then, the distance between the two leaders' positions on a host of issues had closed rapidly.
To some experts, Mr. Bush has traveled the greater distance toward Mr. Putin's view of a collaborative new security structure in the world. It was Mr. Putin who, earlier this year, spoke forcefully in an interview with American correspondents in Moscow about the need for Russia and the United States to confront the threat of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. 
"I feel that I personally am to blame for what happened," Mr. Putin said in the wake of the attacks. "Yes, I talked a great deal about that threat, but I guess it wasn't enough."
Mr. Putin's goal has been "to shift the United States away from the illusion that it is leading a unipolar world," said Clifford G. Gaddy of the Brookings Institution in Washington during a forum last week. "I stress the word illusion because Putin and other Russians never thought that this was objectively possible," he added.
There are still many prominent skeptics, like Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter, who argue that it is premature to conclude that Russia has made a historic choice in favor of the West, but rather may simply be maneuvering cleverly to lay the most advantageous foundation for a long-term rebuilding of Russian national power.
"I would say that joining the West is exactly what Putin is not about," Mr. Gaddy said. "What Putin is about is, with respect to the U.S., is that he is absolutely convinced that the U.S. must not be allowed to continue to go it alone."

Memo to: Michael R. Bloomberg.
 Re: Advice from experts, academics, union leaders, politicians and ordinary New Yorkers on coping with business, transportation, housing, education, race relations and municipal labor unions. 
 Effective: Jan. 1, 2002.
Institute tax-free days on some retail goods. Begin charging tolls on East River bridges. Build housing on industrial sites. End political fighting over schools and think of the one million pupils as your children. Make your administration racially and ethnically diverse and its spending policies fair. Keep a lid on city labor costs, but don't lose teachers or police officers to the suburbs. Hold down the deficits, but preserve those city services. 
These are just a few ideas to get you started. Good luck!
As the city's economic health worsens, it is important to remember an undisputed lesson of the 70's fiscal crisis: as crime and schools go, so goes the city.
"I think everybody feels kind of depressed because everybody's kind of worried," said Sylvia Wertheimer, the mother of a seventh grader in Chelsea. "I know of several people who have moved out of the city partly because they lived close to downtown, but also because if you think your kids can't get a good education, it could be another tipping factor."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's attitude toward city schools, at least before Sept. 11, was often confrontational, even obstructionist. Many people hope Mr. Bloomberg's tone will be different. "I would not like to see the situation of the mayor continuing his role of sort of strong-arming the school system," said Bertha Lewis, an organizer for Acorn, a neighborhood advocacy group in Brooklyn. 
The mayor-elect has said he wants to put city schools under mayoral control, and Assembly Democrats have said they are willing to talk about it in a civil manner. "I don't begrudge anyone that there ought to be some form of major change in the administrative structure of education," said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, chairman of the education committee. "But a cooperative venture between City Hall and public education is desperately needed."
In the mayoral election, black, Hispanic and white voters were split. So were reading and math scores in the public schools. Everyone agrees that this needs to be fixed. "Here's what a Republican would look at," said Diane Ravitch, the education historian. "Not, are the employees happy, but are the customers satisfied -- and the customers are the children. There are a million-plus children, and I think it's an immensely important leap to say, what if every child were the mayor's child?"
Chancellor Harold O. Levy's contract expires July 1, and the Board of Education must decide before then whether to extend it. "There are many good people out there who could do this job," Randi Weingarten, president of the teachers' union, said about the chancellor's job. "My advice would be to make those decisions quickly, depoliticize the situation."
There is more important work to be done, like teaching grammar and algebra and creating safe, competent high schools for average students, parents said. "We need more emphasis on basic instruction," Ms. Wertheimer said. "Our kids need it. I think probably a lot of teachers would agree. That's not a money thing, that's a frustration. For some reason that message doesn't seem to get through. There's some kind of invisible barrier. I don't know what it is." ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

Halting Business Flight

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Memo to: Michael R. Bloomberg.
 Re: Advice from experts, academics, union leaders, politicians and ordinary New Yorkers on coping with business, transportation, housing, education, race relations and municipal labor unions. 
 Effective: Jan. 1, 2002.
Institute tax-free days on some retail goods. Begin charging tolls on East River bridges. Build housing on industrial sites. End political fighting over schools and think of the one million pupils as your children. Make your administration racially and ethnically diverse and its spending policies fair.

Dozens of businesses, employing thousands of workers, could not help but leave Manhattan after Sept. 11. If their offices were not reduced to dust, they were shrouded in it, caught in the zone around ground zero where debris and rescue equipment dominated the landscape. Weeks later, most of them have not returned, preferring to wait out the continuing economic aftershocks in temporary space elsewhere.
To lure those businesses back, and to keep others from fleeing, will require a tactical and a strategic response, said Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, before that, the chairman of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
In the short term, Mr. Levitt recommends creative promotional incentives to restore business activity in Lower Manhattan, like tax-free days for certain kinds of retail goods, and other incentives to attract companies to the area. Keeping companies downtown will require Mr. Bloomberg to address issues like transportation. A light-rail project or regionally sponsored ferry service that offers access from more distant points should be considered, Mr. Levitt said. And using devices like special economic zones to attract construction will be critical.
In either the short or long term, he said, "One thing I would not do would be to use the remedy that is most often used and which I used myself: pure tax subsidies to keep companies and to induce companies to come down there."
The most important long-term strategy, he maintained, is to avoid bidding against other other states or cities to recruit or keep businesses. "You can't do that without getting the cooperation of other regional long-term planners," Mr. Levitt said. "Companies will simply delight in playing you off one another."
As important as large corporations are to any plan to keep businesses from fleeing the downtown area, small businesses also have to have an attractive environment in which to work, said Fred P. Hochberg, a former administrator of the Small Business Administration. For them, he said, physical amenities are not as important as financial ones. 
For example, he said, the city could promote legislation or actually put up the money to guarantee up to 90 percent of the amount of a small-business loan, 15 percent more than the maximum 75 percent guarantee already provided by the federal government. This could encourage banks to lend to businesses that they might otherwise reject.
Also, Mr. Hochberg said, Mr. Bloomberg should encourage federal agencies to spend more of their $200 billion annual budget for goods in New York City. Currently, 40 other states get more of those federal dollars than does New York State. "I think the key thing is that New York should not be asked to go it alone," he said. EDWARD WYATT

Healing Ethnic Rifts

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
Memo to: Michael R. Bloomberg.
Re: Advice from experts, academics, union leaders, politicians and ordinary New Yorkers on coping with business, transportation, housing, education, race relations and municipal labor unions.
 Effective: Jan. 1, 2002. 
 Institute tax-free days on some retail goods. Begin charging tolls on East River bridges. Build housing on industrial sites. End political fighting over schools and think of the one million pupils as your children. Make your administration racially and ethnically diverse and its spending policies fair. Keep a lid on city labor costs, but don't lose teachers or police officers to the suburbs. Hold down the deficits, but preserve those city services. 
These are just a few ideas to get you started. Good luck!
After one of the city's most fractious elections, Mr. Bloomberg, a novice politician, is faced with the daunting challenge of healing ethnic rifts and addressing minority concerns against the backdrop of a looming fiscal crisis.
Oddly, that task has been inadvertently eased by Mayor Giuliani, whose policies, many of them unpopular with blacks and Latinos, Mr. Bloomberg promised to build upon. As the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the current mayor's most outspoken critics, said of Mr. Bloomberg: "Coming behind someone that is perceived to be as hostile as Giuliani, he almost can't help but do better. The question is, how much better?"
Already, officials and advocates said, Mr. Bloomberg has made all the right moves: an early breakfast with Fernando Ferrer, a picture-perfect handshake with Mr. Sharpton at a gala reception for the group 100 Black Men, and festive meetings with representatives of organized labor.
But his honeymoon may not last long. Mr. Bloomberg's first task is making appointments, and several officials and consultants said that he must make the administration reflect the ethnic diversity of the city it serves. Bill Lynch, the vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee, a senior adviser to Mr. Ferrer's campaign, said that this is important because members of minority communities feel that they have been shut out of government under the Giuliani administration.
Others said that an integrated cabinet would make unpopular decisions easier to swallow for minorities. "When they see people that look like them," said Luis Miranda, a political consultant, "it's not some foreign power that's making these decisions."
Across City Hall from the mayor's office, Mr. Bloomberg will find a remade City Council, including a new generation of younger, more aggressive and more activist-oriented members. Bill Perkins, a council member from Harlem, said that because blacks and Latinos (and one Asian) will compose nearly half the body, the new mayor would be wise to forge a relationship with them. "We are the voices of our communities, the leaders of our communities that are here, in the city, every day, not in Albany, not in Washington," he said. 
But beyond appointments and relationships, several consultants and officials said, the new mayor should also put the city's money where his mouth is.
"The proof is always in the pudding, said Adolfo Carrion, the incoming Bronx borough president. "The way you mean what you say is how you spend the resources that you have."
In other words, the officials and advocates will be watching the mayor's first spending plan in January to make sure that the economic belt tightens evenly across the belly of the city, and that education and social service programs considered crucial in minority communities are not automatically cut. They will also be watching, they said, to make sure Mr. Bloomberg tackles their ongoing concerns about police-community relations and includes them in the rebuilding effort from Sept. 11.
"Political people have to see themselves in the planning, and business people have to see themselves in the rebuilding," Mr. Lynch said. "They can't be left out or we'll have the same divisions as we had over the last eight years." DIANE CARDWELL

Easing the Housing Crunch

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. MCFADDEN 

 BODY:
Memo to: Michael R. Bloomberg.
Re: Advice from experts, academics, union leaders, politicians and ordinary New Yorkers on coping with business, transportation, housing, education, race relations and municipal labor unions.
 Effective: Jan. 1, 2002. 
 Institute tax-free days on some retail goods. Begin charging tolls on East River bridges. Build housing on industrial sites. End political fighting over schools and think of the one million pupils as your children. Make your administration racially and ethnically diverse and its spending policies fair. Keep a lid on city labor costs, but don't lose teachers or police officers to the suburbs. Hold down the deficits, but preserve those city services. 
These are just a few ideas to get you started. Good luck!
If there is one thing that government officials, community leaders, academic experts and ordinary residents agree on with virtual unanimity, it is that New York City is in the grip of its worst housing crisis in years. Of course, New Yorkers have said that for generations, with justification.
The litany never seems to change. Rents are staggeringly high. Vacancy rates are minuscule. Overcrowding abounds. Construction and rehabilitation of housing are thwarted by high costs and a maze of city regulations. And the city is short of money for subsidies, especially since Sept. 11.
Mr. Bloomberg, in his campaign, offered no detailed housing plan, but said he philosophically opposed new subsidies and would try to encourage private development by uncluttering city regulations and searching for building sites in waterfront areas and former industrial brownfields.
Mayor Giuliani had a new plan last January calling for for $600 million in city financing and an equal amount from the private sector to build or renovate 10,000 housing units over the next four years. (Some experts have said the city needs 30,000 units a year to keep up.) Mr. Giuliani also spoke of the great dream: reforming the bureaucracy and cutting construction costs.
Many of his ideas were based on a book of which Michael H. Schill, a housing expert and professor of law and urban planning at New York University, was a co-author. Asked the other day what he might advise Mr. Giuliani's successor, Professor Schill bubbled with ideas.
Mr. Bloomberg's top priorities, he said, should be changes to make the city a partner rather than an impediment to housing construction, an all-out effort to rehabilitate existing housing, and targeted subsidies for low- and moderate-income housing.
To cut building costs and streamline city bureaucratic processes, Professor Schill urged Mr. Bloomberg to order a sweeping review of zoning regulations to identify land that could be shifted from manufacturing to housing; to direct city agencies to expedite permits and other costly, time-consuming paperwork, and to modernize a complex 1961 building code that bars many cost-saving materials and practices that are standard elsewhere.
"Some agencies, like the Buildings Department, need a complete overhaul," Professor Schill said. "This should be catnip for someone like Bloomberg. He's a manager. The Buildings Department is years out of date, not fully automated with computers and new technology. A lot of it is paper records. It's operating back in the 1950's and 60's, not 2001. Bloomberg can make enormous strides."
Professor Schill urged the next mayor to expand a Giuliani program that has turned tax-delinquent housing over to new owners who pledge to rehabilitate it with the help of subsidies. He noted that the city faced big deficits and that housing money may be hard to find, but said that available subsidies should be used for low- and moderate-income housing.
"Even though housing subsidies are limited, they should be targeted to people who need it most," he said. "It's ludicrous, its scandalous, that even middle-class people can't be adequately housed through the market." ROBERT D. McFADDEN

HEADLINE: EXAMINING THE VOTE: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Who Won Florida? The Answer Emerges, but Surely Not the Final Word

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
The comprehensive review of the uncounted Florida ballots solidifies George W. Bush's legal claim on the White House because it concludes that he would have won under the ground rules prescribed by the Democrats.
 But the analysis does not diminish the heartbreaking might-have-beens for Al Gore. It suggests that more Floridians intended to vote for Mr. Gore but were deterred, in some cases by ballots that were confounding even to elderly voters who are accustomed to having five bingo cards going at once. (No wonder networks reported on election night that, based on polls of voters leaving the polls, Mr. Gore had won Florida.) 
 The reality, therefore, is that Mr. Bush's victory in the most fouled-up, disputed and wrenching presidential election in American history was so breathtakingly narrow that there is no way of knowing with absolute precision who got the most votes. After all, there is no perfect way to decide which disputed ballots should be counted and rejected. 
And there never will be.
"You had the perfect tie," said Walter Dean Burnham, a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, making a statistical point that many scholars have fastened on to. "When you've got an election this close, the most sensible way to determine the outcome is to flip a coin."
Had the analysis concluded that under every conceivable circumstance, Mr. Gore would have triumphed under a statewide recount, or that there had been fraud or other mischief, the Democrats would have had reason to speak out today. But it found that even if the Supreme Court had not stepped in to block a statewide manual recount, Mr. Bush would have won.
Absent an unambiguous outcome, a debate could fester for decades around kitchen tables of partisan Americans: Did the right guy capture the prize?
Diehard Bush supporters will always declare themselves the deserved winners. Just as passionately, diehard Gore supporters, the ones who cried at Mr. Bush's inaugural, will always believe they were robbed. There will also be the conspiracy theorists, the same people who thought publication of this analysis was delayed because of a plot by newspapers to keep secret that Mr. Gore would have won. (The reality is that it took months to count, tabulate and analyze the results, which were further delayed by the events since Sept. 11.)
And of course, there may never be closure for Mr. Gore himself -- unless he ultimately becomes president. In recent weeks he has been ambling alone around Iowa and New Hampshire in a rental car, knowing that were it not for a twist of fate -- or a faulty voting machine here and there -- he might be commanding a nation at war.
But for all the drama of those 36 days last fall, most of the country moved on long ago. In history, the two anchors of the American political process are whether an election is regarded as final and whether there was an orderly transition of power. Mr. Gore, in fact, did his best to encourage that stability last December when he implored the nation "to unite behind our next president."
Today, in a statement, Mr. Gore recalled that concession, saying, "As I said on Dec. 13 of last year, we are a nation of laws and the presidential election of 2000 is over."
That message has taken hold well beyond the capital. "People quickly accommodated themselves to the notion that it's over," said Richard G. Niemi, a political scientist at the University of Rochester who specializes in voting. "What are we to do? Cut short Bush's term?"
Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, was more mesmerized by football this evening than the consortium's findings. "This inconclusive number crunching doesn't change anything," he said. "Anybody who invests time and money in this is wasting their time and money. The president is paying no attention to this -- and neither is the country."
While the recriminations over last Nov. 7 were fading anyway, the attacks on Sept. 11 drowned them out even more. Many partisan Democrats are loath to question the legitimacy of a president in wartime. Even if they wanted to, how do you challenge a president who is basking in job approval ratings of close to 90 percent?
William J. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said he, for one, never dwells on the election. "Anybody who speculates on such stuff at this point is wasting air, especially in the middle of what's going on," he said. "Do people care anymore? I don't think they do."
With their fiery cries of injustice, Democrats had hoped to seize on the muddled outcome to, at the very least, rev up partisans for the 2002 midterm elections, particularly blacks who said they had been disenfranchised from voting. When he was elected Democratic Party chairman last February, Terence McAuliffe, vowed, "We will transform the anger about Florida into energy about politics."
Today, Mr. McAuliffe was far more tame, mindful that he not inflame an electorate that may be struggling with matters of war. "I am determined to turn the voters' disappointment into action," he said. But Mr. McAuliffe's only mention of Mr. Bush was that Democrats stand united with him against terrorism.
The lack of a crisper verdict in his favor means that it could be more difficult for Mr. Gore to again seek the presidency in 2004 on the argument that he was unjustly denied the White House.
Many of his supporters from last year say he has forfeited an opportunity to establish himself as the Democratic president-in-waiting by refusing to speak out critically about Mr. Bush. After all, they say, Mr. Gore won the popular vote.
But Mr. Gore, presumably not wanting to appear to be a sore loser, chose not to go the route of President Grover Cleveland, who in 1888 won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College -- and the White House -- to Benjamin Harrison. Mr. Cleveland never let the public forget that he thought he should be president. Four years later, he defeated Mr. Harrison, a Republican.
Mr. Gore's reticence prompted a onetime supporter, Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, to say late this summer, "I don't think Al Gore acts like a man who wants to be president of the United States."
By the time Mr. Gore had decided to question Mr. Bush's policies, it was too late: the terrorists had struck.
The legacy of the troubled election may be tighter voting procedures, but only if the government is willing to spend the money on them.
More important, the ultimate verdict on the 2000 election will be the election of 2004. If Mr. Bush is re-elected, that would go far to quash lingering talk of illegitimacy. But if Mr. Gore runs again, and the economy is in peril, that could give the former vice president an opening to cast the election of 2000 through the prism of what people's lives are like at the time.
If Americans are hurting financially in 2004, Mr. Gore could say he was cheated out of the presidency -- and that the people were cheated too.

HEADLINE: Under Bloomberg, Kelly Will Guide Police Again 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Raymond W. Kelly, who was New York City's 37th police commissioner, under Mayor David N. Dinkins, has accepted Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg's offer to return to 1 Police Plaza as the city's 41st police commissioner, two people familiar with the transition plan said yesterday.
 The announcement could be made as early as today, they said. 
 When Mr. Kelly led the Police Department during the last 17 months of the Dinkins administration, the crime rate began to fall. He became familiar to many New Yorkers as a reassuring presence on television after the World Trade Center bombing in February 1993. 
In returning to a city left shaken and apprehensive by the recent destruction of the twin towers, Mr. Kelly will become the first man in the history of New York to serve as police commissioner in two nonconsecutive administrations.
Mr. Bloomberg declined to confirm the appointment, which was first reported in Newsday yesterday. "Well, I did read that in the papers yesterday," he said in an interview on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press." "Stay tuned. He's a great guy."
In the interview, the mayor-elect went on to show a great familiarity with Mr. Kelly's resume, praising the work he did after leaving the Police Department, as the head of an international police force in Haiti and then as the commissioner of the United States Customs Service.
In an interview last week, Mr. Kelly, who served as a campaign adviser to Mr. Bloomberg on law enforcement issues, laid out some principles that he said would guide the Police Department under a Bloomberg administration. He spoke of building on the crime-fighting successes of the Giuliani years while working to improve police-community relations.
Since leaving the Police Department, Mr. Kelly headed an international police force sent to help reform the Haitian police; was appointed an under secretary at the Treasury Department, overseeing its law enforcement agencies; and became the commissioner of the Customs Service. There he was credited with finding more efficient ways to intercept contraband without racial profiling. Most recently he has been the global head of corporate security for Bear Stearns.
By appointing a police commissioner, Mr. Bloomberg would fill a visible and politically important post. 
Until the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 reshaped his legacy, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made crime-fighting the hallmark of his administration. The Compstat program begun under his watch -- in which police commanders use up-to-date computer statistics to map out crime trends -- has been widely credited with helping the police drive crime down to levels not seen since the 1960's. 
Crime and the selection of the next police commissioner became major issues in the recent mayoral campaign, as Mr. Bloomberg and his Democratic rival, Mark Green, sought to reassure voters that neither would roll back the successes of the last eight years.
Both candidates telegraphed their would-be choices to run the department. Mr. Green campaigned frequently at the side of Mr. Giuliani's first police commissioner, William J. Bratton. Mr. Bloomberg talked of trying to retain the current police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, but he also campaigned with Mr. Kelly.
An advertisement for Mr. Bloomberg that was mailed to voters during the last week of the campaign stated: "When Mark Green served in the Dinkins administration, in 1993 alone there were nearly 2,000 murders -- 6 per day." Now Mr. Bloomberg has tapped the man who was Mr. Dinkins's police commissioner at that time.
Mr. Kelly, a former marine, graduated first in his class in the Police Academy, then served in 25 different commands during the next 31 years. 
As police commissioner under Mayor Dinkins, he took over a department that had just faced some of the deadliest years in city history, as the lethal combination of a crack epidemic, a recession and easily available guns drove the murder rate above 2,000 a year. 
Mr. Kelly carried out the Safe Streets, Safe City program, which helped increase the number of police officers to 28,500 from 25,465 during his tenure. The force now stands at nearly 40,000, driven up by more hiring and a merger with the old Transit Police Department. Mr. Kelly championed community policing, in which beat officers were encouraged to get to know their neighborhoods and help solve their problems as well as arrest their criminals. 
Murders and overall crime began to fall under his watch, but when Mr. Giuliani defeated Mr. Dinkins and took office in 1994, he looked to Boston for his own commissioner, appointing Mr. Bratton, who was that city's police commissioner. Giuliani administration officials let it be known right away that they disapproved of community policing, disparaging it as "glorified social work," and Mr. Kelly let it be known that he was not happy about their attempt to tarnish his legacy.
Mr. Kelly's supporters have long lamented that he was never given much credit for beginning to turn the tide against crime. Now he is about to receive a rare second chance to try to prove himself. 
One person familiar with the transition plan, who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified, said that Mr. Kelly, 60, accepted the job on Friday, and that the official announcement would be made today. Campaign officials would not confirm that.
As he prepared to march in the city's Veterans Day Parade yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg was mum about his plans for the Police Department. 
"Today we're here to celebrate our current police commissioner, Mr. Kerik, who's been a great commissioner," he said. "I think it's important to remember that during the entire Giuliani administration, crime kept coming down, and every time it gets to a low, you say you can't make it any better, and Bernie showed that that's not true; there's always room for improvement."

HEADLINE: LVMH Sales Dropped 5% In October 

BYLINE:  By K ERRY SHAW 

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
In its third warning of deteriorating results since the Sept. 11 terror attacks, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton said today that its sales in October fell 5 percent from the period last year and that its operating profits for the full year might be 15 percent lower than forecast.
 The company, which manufactures and markets a wide range of luxury goods under well-known brands like Louis Vuitton leather goods, Kenzo clothing and Dior perfumes, said that the trouble stemmed from the deep slump in a crucial market segment: tourists. 
 "People stopped traveling," said Olivier Labesse, a spokesman for the company. "When people travel, they love to buy a bag or a watch." 
The company said the outlook in North America remained bleak but signs of improvement were "gradually appearing in some European countries, in Asia and in Japan."
LVMH has more than 600 retail outlets specifically aimed at tourists, including 292 in the United States, 26 of them in New York City. Duty-free stores at airports around the world are also an important sales channel.
"Our strategy is the same as it has been in times of crisis, for example, during the gulf war in 1991 and during the Asian financial crisis," Mr. Labesse said. "We're going to maintain advertising for main brands, keep developing new stores and reduce costs. We can win market shares during the crisis -- we can be poised to be the leader when the market rebounds. We just don't know when that will be."
After the profit warning, shares of LVMH fell 3.1 percent today, closing at 40.78 euros in Paris.
Rival luxury goods makers are also hurting; Prada Holding and the Gucci Group have reported slow sales, and Escada said today that it would post a loss for the year.
There is one step LVMH has said it will take to try to reduce its costs: cutting back on travel.

HEADLINE: Chiquita Gets Debt Relief In Exchange For Equity 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Chiquita Brands International said today that it had reached a long-awaited agreement with creditors that would give senior debt holders almost 88 percent of the company's equity in return for cutting its debt and interest expenses.
 As the company said previously, it will file a prearranged reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. 
 The plan will cut debt and accrued interest by more than $700 million, while reducing Chiquita's interest costs by about $60 million a year, the company said. 
Chiquita said in January that it would restructure $861 million of public debt after losing more than $1.5 billion over eight years during a dispute with the European Union over banana imports.
"This restructuring and the recent settlement of the U.S.-E.U. banana trade dispute are both significant events that will reinforce Chiquita's prospects for strong revenue and earnings growth," the chief executive, Steven Warshaw, said.
Shares of Chiquita fell 9 cents, to 60 cents.
Chiquita, which is based in Cincinnati, said it would issue 40 million new shares in the restructuring, which involves only the corporation's publicly held debt and equity.
Other creditors and Chiquita's assets, strategy and continuing operations will be unaffected by the Chapter 11 filing, the company said.
Holders of the company's $775 million in senior debt will receive 35.1 million shares, or 87.75 percent, of the new stock. They will also receive $250 million of new senior notes.
Current common stock will be exchanged for 550,000 shares, or 1.38 percent, of the new common stock, plus new warrants to buy 9.2 million shares of additional new common stock, or 17.21 percent of the new stock on a fully diluted basis.
Management will receive 1 million shares, or 2.5 percent, of the new common stock.
Existing preferred stock will be exchanged for 250,000 shares of the new common stock plus new warrants to buy 4.2 million shares of additional new common stock.

HEADLINE: Property Lending Up in Some Cases 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Commercial mortgage lending rose 32 percent in the third quarter, spurred by falling interest rates, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said yesterday. 
 Loans on commercial property like apartment buildings and office complexes totaled $18.7 billion, compared with $14.1 billion in the similar period of 2000, a survey of United States lenders by the trade group found. 
 Commercial mortgage rates averaged 7.22 percent in the second quarter, the latest period for which data was available, down almost 1.5 percentage points from its peak in 2000, according to the American Council of Life Insurers.
But even with rates down, some property owners are refinancing rather than selling at low prices, especially after the terrorist attacks in September, analysts said.
"Indications are that volumes for the fourth quarter were approaching or exceeding pre-Sept. 11 levels," the mortgage bankers' group said. 
A majority of investment banks, pension funds, commercial banks and life insurers said that with the economy slowing, they were tightening their underwriting criteria.

HEADLINE: The Rust Belt With a Drawl; 
States ofthe Interior South Mired in Worst Downturn In Nearly Two Decades

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: GADSDEN, Ala. 

 BODY:
In a patch of land that once held pine, spruce and oak trees, an auto-parts maker opened a modern-looking manufacturing plant here five years ago. Over on the east side of town, another company makes computer circuit boards on a former military base. And an hour and a half to the northwest, a telecommunications equipment factory sits in a field that produced cotton a decade ago.
 With great fanfare, much of the Southeastern United States diversified its economic base over the last two decades, luring giant auto companies, sprouting new technology centers and raising hopes that the region would not just enjoy greater prosperity but also weather hard times better in the future than it had in the past. 
 Instead, the opposite has happened. Even before Sept. 11, the interior South -- stretching from Alabama into Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana and up through Tennessee and Kentucky -- was mired in its worst downturn in almost two decades. 
In the weeks since the attacks, the recession here has only deepened, as consumer spending has weakened and the manufacturing sector has been hit by another blow. With the country at war, some executives are even discussing whether they should begin to pursue military contracts for the first time in years.
Partly because of the region's efforts to diversify, and partly in spite of them, the old Bible Belt has become the nation's new Rust Belt, suffering first and worst from the nation's economic distress.
"The rural South is to this recession as Detroit was to the 1980's recession," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, a West Chester, Pa., consulting firm that closely follows regional trends.
Through early September, the six-state region had lost 36,000 jobs this year -- more than twice as many, per capita, as the rest of the country -- according to the government's most recent state-by-state employment figures.
As was the case in the Midwest in the mid-1980's and in the Northeast at the beginning of the 1990's, many people here are wondering whether the current downturn in the South augurs years of struggle or will serve as a painful but necessary cure for today's ailments.
On the one hand, the economic decline could clear out some of the region's weaker businesses and force others to become stronger, much as American car companies emerged from the devastation of the 1980's in a better position to compete with the Japanese and Europeans.
"The economy of today is a transitional one," Gov. Ronnie Musgrove of Mississippi said in an interview. Companies that have moved to Mexico and the Caribbean, seeking lower labor costs in the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement, would have left the region eventually, he added, and now local officials and business leaders can focus on attracting better-paying jobs by improving the region's schools. 
But many residents are worried that without the large corporate headquarters that nearby states like Georgia and Texas have, much of the region will soon lack both high-paying work for college graduates and solidly middle-class jobs that high school and community college graduates have long relied upon.
In Gadsden -- a small city that sits astride the Coosa River in the Appalachian foothills, 60 miles northeast of Birmingham -- college graduates say there are virtually none of the opportunities available in places like Atlanta or Houston. And many less-educated workers have struggled to find any job that can pay their bills since a large steel mill closed last year.
Since the spring of last year, Gadsden has lost about 2,000 jobs, or roughly 5 percent of the city's total. Since those numbers were compiled, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Gadsden's biggest employer, said it would eliminate about 200 of its 1,400 jobs.
Analysts attribute the harshness of the region's downturn here to two fundamental causes, neither of which shows signs of letting up.
For one thing, globalization and freer trade have hastened the long decline of the South's old industries, like lumber, steel and textiles, by easing the move of businesses to countries with lower wages. The high value of the dollar, reflecting investors' continued long-term confidence in the United States, has only added to that pressure by making foreign-made goods less expensive compared with American products. 
Equally important, many of the South's newer industries sell their products not directly to consumers but to major companies, which have caused much of the national slowdown by sharply cutting back on business investment. The South's downturn, said Ferrel Guillory, the director of a regional studies program at the University of North Carolina, "is a combination of the collapse of the old economy accelerating and the new economy being shaken."
When Gulf States Steel filed for bankruptcy last year, citing overseas competition, it left 1,700 Gadsden-area residents without work at the time that new local employers, like makers of auto parts and computer chips, had themselves begun cutting workers' hours and laying some off.
"It's rough," said Kelvin D. Huff, who had worked for the steel company for 13 years. On Mr. Huff's weekly pay of about $600, he bought a house and expanded it. Now, while he takes classes on auto repair at a local college, he receives $190 a week in unemployment insurance and has spent more than half of his $40,000 in retirement savings.
"There aren't that many jobs in Gadsden that pay the kind of money Gulf States did," Mr. Huff said. "And there are a lot of things you can buy when you're making $600 a week that you can't with $190 a week."
The layoffs and factory shift reductions here have eliminated so much income that even service businesses, the last to suffer in a downturn, began to slump badly before Sept. 11. Since the attacks, the rest of the nation's economy has begun to follow the region's lead.
Mr. Huff, for example, no longer makes regular trips to a casino in Philadelphia, Miss. A number of Gadsden restaurants have closed in the last year, including the Quincy's Family Steakhouse that has kept a "Happy Holidays" sign out front for months, reminding passing drivers of when it shut down.
Since the Depression, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the South "the nation's No. 1 economic problem," the region has waged a mighty battle to improve its fortunes. In 1936, Mississippi began a program called Balance Agriculture With Industry, in which it tried to woo Northern businesses by trumpeting the state's low wages, few labor unions and many available white workers, according to James C. Cobb, a University of Georgia historian.
Minus the racial aspect, the sales pitch has remained similar for the last 65 years. States have offered tax breaks and other financial incentives to lure companies to the South, and many corporations -- including in recent years DaimlerBenz, BMW and Honda from overseas -- have helped diversify the region's economy.
But outside of the biggest urban areas, the Southeast still depends disproportionately on the volatile manufacturing sector. When an economy slows, more people reduce their spending on things like new appliances than on health care or food. Companies are also able to move factories to other countries in ways that are impossible for, say, hospitals or supermarkets.
"Over the last 30 years, there's been a massive convergence of the economy of the South and the economy of the nation," said Mr. Guillory, the regional expert at the University of North Carolina. "Yet there's still a disadvantageous industrial mix."
Mid-South Industries, the Gadsden company that has its headquarters on a former military base, is typical of the changes and the problems.
Founded in 1962 as a maker of tools and industrial equipment, the company became a government contractor within a couple of years. By 1980, it was also making small appliances for well-known companies to sell under their brand names, like KitchenAid.
Over the next decade, however, the major appliance brands turned to factories in Mexico to make many of their smaller products. By the mid-1990's, the government was cutting back on its military spending, too.
The company responded by changing its product mix, making circuit boards; small electronics; and large metal parts, like doors for cars and ovens. Then, almost without warning, the slowdown of mid-2000 arrived. "It just kind of happened, all of a sudden," said Lina Stewart, Mid-South Industries' marketing director. "There weren't a lot of signs."
A telecommunications company canceled orders, and car companies needed fewer parts. The sprawling floor where a largely male work force pounds out metal parts became quieter as Mid-South Industries told some employees to stay home on Fridays. The brightly lighted assembly lines where mostly women make circuit boards and telecommunications equipment slowed its output.
Mid-South Industries laid off about 50 employees in Gadsden and forced its workers to take a week off in October. Those who could count it as vacation got paid, and those who had no vacation days did not, Ms. Stewart said. The company may take the same step again before the end of the year.
Company executives are also wondering whether they should try to capitalize on Mid-South Industries' experience as a past maker of grenade casings to bid for future military contracts. But even though the South is home to many military bases and contractors, the war in Afghanistan is unlikely to have more than a small effect on the regional economy, said Matthew Freedman, who follows the South at Economy .com.
Nobody seems to doubt Mid-South Industries is better off for having diversified its economic base, much as Gadsden is stronger for having attracted new companies.
Mid-South Industries, however, is in no position to hire the hundreds of former steel workers and tire workers who have lost their jobs around here. A new Honda Motor auto plant that is now opening 35 miles to the south, in Lincoln, should provide work for some residents, but not enough to pick up the slack. 
"There's just no growth here -- period," said Doug Jenkins, who retired last year after 33 years at the local Goodyear tire plant.
Mr. Jenkins, who spends much of his time on a golf course, likes his life here but does not think either of his two sons can repeat it. After they graduated from college, he urged them to leave. They followed his advice, moving to Houston and jobs in the computer industry.
"I told them their future was not in Gadsden," Mr. Jenkins said. "The smart kids are leaving."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Budget Deficit Brings a Threat of Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
One day before the State Legislature was to begin a special session to address a $300 million budget deficit, Republican Gov. John G. Rowland today threatened to lay off state employees if the Democratic leadership failed to resolve the budget gap. 
 Mr. Rowland would not say how many people could lose their jobs. But he said the cuts could begin after the session, which is expected to start Tuesday and end Friday. 
 "If the Legislature does not take action in this special session, if the Legislature fails to have any leadership in reducing this budget and fails to understand the sense of urgency, you are probably going to see layoffs after Friday," Mr. Rowland said during a news conference in his office. "That would be the only way you could save the money."
The statement provoked a sharp rebuke from the Democratic leadership. Kevin B. Sullivan, a West Hartford Democrat and the Senate president pro tempore, accused Mr. Rowland of using scare tactics. Layoffs are not necessary and would be unwise, he said.
"That would be a severe mistake in a bad economy," Mr. Sullivan said. 
The governor has said that the gap in the state's $13 billion budget is a result of lower tax revenue following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and an economic downturn nationwide.
Initially, Democratic legislative leaders said the special session was unnecessary. Budget deficiencies caused by overspending are typically discussed by legislators in the spring, said George C. Jepsen, Democrat of Stamford and the majority leader of the State Senate.
But by late October legislators agreed that the revenue shortage and budget problems that were evident before the terror attacks had worsened and a special session was arranged. 
Both sides agreed that they wanted to hold the session before the holidays and wrap it up in a week, Mr. Rowland said. So he questioned why the Democrats had urged legislators not to attend the first day of the session. "What kind of message is that?" Mr. Rowland asked. "That's a total lack of leadership."
But Mr. Sullivan said there was no point for many legislators in attending the first day. Republicans and Democrats are still working with the Office of Policy and Management to develop a bipartisan plan to address the deficit. 
He said it was unlikely that a vote would be taken on any proposals until Thursday or Friday.
"It's a little like saying that everybody ought to show up for the movie even though there isn't going to be one shown," Mr. Sullivan said. 
Democratic and Republican lawmakers have been working on a budget plan for about three weeks, Mr. Sullivan said. They have already agreed on a way to cover at least $124 million of the gap, using both spending cuts and borrowing initiatives that would take advantage of low interest rates, he said. 
Mr. Rowland said he would not entertain the possibility of borrowing money to close the gap unless some "substantial reductions in spending" were made.

PERSON: Carrie Donovan 

HEADLINE: Carrie Donovan, One-of-a-Kind Fashion Editor and TV's 'Old Navy Lady,' Dies at 73 

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN 

 BODY:
Carrie Donovan, a fashion editor who could easily have rested on her laurels and leopard skins but came out of semiretirement to find a new and even more enthusiastic audience as "the lady from Old Navy," died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 73.
 She had been ailing for several months, said George O'Brien, a friend, and died at New York Weill Cornell Center. 
 From the beginning, Ms. Donovan's career had a screwball quality worthy of Hollywood. Though she studied dressmaking at the Parsons School of Design, she could never master a needle and thread. She lacked a similar command of automobiles and typewriters, and as a reporter for The New York Times, then as an editor for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and The New York Times Magazine, she wrote all her copy by hand. 
And though she was among the first to applaud the designs of Donna Karan and Perry Ellis and brought a virtually unknown Elsa Peretti to the attention of Tiffany, Ms. Donovan was something of an Auntie Mame when it came to managing her own affairs. Money was silk in her fingers, and the rest was often serendipity. 
"She was perfectly cast for a fashion editor," said Karl Lagerfeld, the designer. "She was the leading lady of that role."
What Ms. Donovan possessed was an eye for talent and a nose for news, a combination that, with her inevitable pearls and outsized black glasses, set her apart from her fashion sisters. She loved the fantastical, which was reflected in her Upper East Side apartment -- with its red walls, red furnishings and leopard carpeting -- but in her editorial pages she was adamantly on the side of readers. She may have been French in her leanings, sprinkling her pronouncements with French meme choses, but in her translations of fashion's edicts, she was as American as Carrie.
As her mentor Diana Vreeland once told her: "My dear, you've got the common touch!"
Nowhere did she apply this more surprisingly than in her television ads for Old Navy, which began running in fall 1997. In all, Ms. Donovan appeared in 42 spots, including one that featured her piloting an airplane with a dog named Magic. If Ms. Donovan, the last of a trilogy of great fashion dames that included Mrs. Vreeland and Carmel Snow of Bazaar, reigned in a small world, she now had fans everywhere. Teenagers and grandmothers alike hailed her in the street, sometimes singing an Old Navy jingle.
"She was tickled pink," the director Joel Schumacher, a friend since the 1960's, said of her new visibility. "It made her a celebrity."
As a child in Lake Placid, N.Y., where Carolyn Gertrude Amelia Donovan was born on March 22, 1928, she craved fashion, and struggled with home economics. At 10, she sent the actress Jane Wyman sketches for a wardrobe, and received a handwritten reply.
Her first job was in the hat department at Saks under the imperious Tatiana Liberman, whose husband was Alexander Liberman of Vogue. By the time Ms. Donovan graduated from Parsons School of Design in 1950, she had formed friendships with two of the world's leading dressmakers, Norman Norell and Jacques Fath. More would follow.
But Ms. Donovan's outgoing personality masked an ambivalent relationship with her mother, Margaret, and an isolated childhood spent with grandparents. She and her sister, Joan Donovan, saw nothing of their father, who left the family early, and the girls did not live regularly with their mother until 1942, when the independent-minded Margaret was working for a war production factory in Brooklyn. She later received a teaching degree from Columbia University.
All her career, Ms. Donovan, who is survived by her sister, of Cambridge, Mass., left the impression that she and Margaret were opposites.
In 1955, recognizing her limitations as a designer, Ms. Donovan went to work as a fashion reporter for The Times, where, according to Mr. O'Brien, a former colleague, she felt outgunned by more experienced writers. She persevered, snaring an interview with Mrs. Vreeland in 1963, when she went to Vogue, and Ms. Donovan soon joined the magazine as one of Mrs. Vreeland's acolytes.
At Vogue, Ms. Donovan flourished, filling her pages with the new and the exciting. She wrote about a young Mr. Schumacher when he and some friends opened a shop called Paraphernalia. On another occasion, a former staff member recalled being sent out to the lobby to tell a group of young men waiting for Ms. Donovan not to sit on the floor. They turned out to be Jim Morrison and the Doors.
She inherited Mrs. Vreeland's mannerisms, like the fortissimo "divine!" but not her mantle, and when Mrs. Vreeland was fired from Vogue in 1971, Ms. Donovan decamped for Bazaar. By then, Ms. Donovan had switched from wearing chaste Mainbocher to chic Halston, and like her friends, the decorators Chessy Rayner and Mica Ertegun, she had taken to covering her blond bob with a turban.
Like other editors of that era, Ms. Donovan was an instigator as well as a tastemaker. In February 1974, she helped bring Tiffany and Ms. Peretti together. The designer said Ms. Donovan had the idea that contemporary jewelry would bring the white-glove store a new customer. Today, that arrangement is a $250 million business. "Nobody would do a favor like this now," Ms. Peretti said.
Unable to perform similar magic at Bloomingdale's, where she worked briefly as a public relations executive, Ms. Donovan returned to The Times in 1977 as style editor of the magazine. At their first meeting, Edward Klein, then editor of the magazine, recalled that Ms. Donovan produced some colored markers and began sketching out her plans, all in a brisk monologue of "mmm's" and exclamation points. Mr. Klein had no idea what she was talking about.
Ms. Donovan was not unaware of her effect, least of all on newspapermen. Armed with tidbits of fashion gossip and "always fully fragranced," as a former protegee, Linda Wells, the editor of Allure, said, Ms. Donovan could turn a routine meeting into a performance. Yet, as her editors knew, her flamboyance was balanced by a pragmatic streak that for 16 years pleased both readers and advertisers.
These were her best years. She introduced readers to Ms. Karan and Paloma Picasso. She documented the opulence of the 1980's and ushered in the next decade by photographing the trendiest clothes on people in their 90's.
Although in many ways Ms. Donovan was simple in her tastes, preferring plain food and the subway, she was also at home in the upper reaches of fashion and society, a friend to Mr. Lagerfeld as well as the philanthropist Bunny Mellon. While this access improved her insight, it occasionally impaired her objectivity.
At the same time, her more dogmatic assertions often betrayed a deeper need to burn her bridges. She and Bill Blass, a frequent escort, fell out in 1993 when Ms. Donovan excluded him from a published list of 50 people who had influenced fashion in modern times.
In 1997, as if to disprove the dictum that there are no second acts in American life, Ms. Donovan went to work for Old Navy, playing herself to the hilt. The ads, which brought her financial security, drew on her flamboyant image to promote earthly things like cargo pants. 
"She gave us fashion credibility," said Dennis Leggett, the creative director at Old Navy, a division of Gap. 
In the final months of her life, Ms. Donovan returned to where her career had begun, The Times. She wrote in its magazine about a little-known designer named Marjan Pejoski, whose feathered-swan dress for the singer Bjork had caused a stir at the Academy Awards. She thought Mr. Pejoski had flair.

HEADLINE: Divided Senate Takes Up Stimulus Bill Today 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
With prospects for a compromise clouded by politics, ideology and pressure from interest groups, the Senate plans to take up a Democratic economic recovery package on Tuesday that has left the two parties bitterly divided.
 Contrary to the bipartisan tone that they pledged to cultivate after the terrorist attacks, the two sides have grown increasingly antagonistic, leaving unclear how or even whether they will find common ground as the nation confronts the prospect of the first recession in 11 years. 
 Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill dismissed the Democratic plan on Friday as "a pathetic spending bill." Labor unions supportive of it have made targets of nine Republican senators and one Democrat with a $2 million advertising campaign this week that criticizes Republicans for supporting tax breaks for big corporations "while leaving laid-off workers to struggle." 
Republicans said the bill was a collection of liberal spending proposals that would do little for the economy and lead to a bloated government. Democrats left the bill open to further criticism by loading it up in the Senate Finance Committee with special-interest provisions, including $5.5 billion over the next decade for bison ranchers, watermelon growers and other farmers.
Last month the House passed a recovery bill of nearly $100 billion that would direct most of its benefits to large businesses. In response, the Senate Democratic proposal would try to revive the economy mainly by putting more money in the hands of unemployed and low-income people and granting businesses tax breaks for investing in equipment. 
"The gloves are off in Washington, and hands are in the till," said Kim Wallace, a political analyst for Lehman Brothers. "In less than a year, Washington's fiscal biorhythm has moved from protecting surpluses to carefree deficit spending."
Given the Senate's procedural rules, which require 60 votes to keep opponents of a bill from blocking it, the Democratic plan has almost no chance of passing in its current form. Republicans said today that they expected to invoke a parliamentary procedure against it, perhaps as soon as the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, brings it to the floor.
"The goal of Senate Republicans," said Ron Bonjean, a spokesman for Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, "would be to try to work with the Democrats to force them to be more bipartisan." 
Democrats said their bill would be fairer and more effective than any of the approaches set out by Republicans, especially the tax-cutting bill passed by the House. 
The Senate bill would inject $66.4 billion into the economy this fiscal year, mostly in the form of increased unemployment benefits, subsidies for health care premiums for people who lose their jobs and one-time cash payments of up to $300 for low-income workers who did not qualify for last summer's tax rebates.
Further, Mr. Daschle has said he will attach to the bill a $20 billion package of spending to deal with what Democrats call domestic security issues, from more money for police and fire departments to increased highway building.
The economic recovery bill is a subject of deep-rooted policy and ideological differences between the parties, with Republicans favoring a top-down approach and Democrats proposing a bottom-up strategy. Republicans say they want to help the economy by helping companies create jobs or avert layoffs. Democrats say they want to put money in the hands of people who have suffered from the downturn and are certain to spend all or most of it, increasing demand for goods and services.
But the partisan debate on the Senate floor is also likely to dwell on what each side has sought to portray as an effort by the other to use the emergency economic package to help favored constituencies.
Democrats point to the provision in the House bill that would repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was established in 1986 to make sure companies could not escape paying federal income taxes through use of write-offs.
In addition to repeal, the House bill would allow companies to claim, in one chunk this year, billions of dollars in credits they have built up over 15 years under terms of the alternative tax. Among the beneficiaries would be I.B.M., which would be able to claim a $1.4 billion refund this year, according to the Congressional Research Service; General Motors, which would get $832 million; and General Electric, which would receive $671 million.
Republicans said the provision was good tax policy and would reduce pressure on big employers to cut costs by laying off more workers. They said the real waste was in the Senate Democratic bill, which, in addition to helping farmers, would provide tax breaks for Amtrak and for owners of crop dusters, give a tax credit to companies that install fiber-optic cable in rural areas and offer all employers in Lower Manhattan a tax break for each of their workers, whether custodians, lawyers or investment bankers.
But both bills would extend a series of expiring tax breaks, including incentives to turn chicken waste into energy and tax credits for electric vehicles.

HEADLINE: Another Plane Crashes 

 BODY:
Not again. A jittery New York steeled itself for another day of unimaginable horror yesterday as another airliner rained terror on the city. The crash of American Airlines Flight 587 shortly after takeoff from Kennedy Airport led to an immediate closing of all area airports and major bridges and tunnels, an evacuation of the Empire State Building and a partial lockdown of the United Nations. 
 Precisely what brought down the airliner, an Airbus A-300 bound for the Dominican Republic, may not be known for some time, but the early sense that this tragedy involved a mechanical failure rather than an act of terrorism seemed to help soothe public nerves. It is a striking commentary on the nation's altered state that news of an airplane accident could come as somewhat of a relief. 
 It shouldn't, of course. The loss of the 260 people aboard the plane and those who died in the Rockaway section of Queens when the plane fell on their world is not minimized by the fact that this disaster may not have been deliberate. Right now, New Yorkers who veered between bottomless grief and frustrated anger after Sept. 11 are left with only the grief. We will wait for the National Transportation Safety Board to learn whether there is someone to blame along with all the victims to mourn. 
Whatever the cause of yesterday's tragedy, it is bound to make the American public even more uncomfortable about returning to the air, and that could have devastating consequences for the nation's battered economy and the industry's finances. Even before yesterday's crash, American Airlines had said it was losing between $10 million and $15 million a day as a result of the slowdown in travel this fall.
The task of rebuilding confidence in the traveling public will now be harder than ever. The airline industry has a good record of learning from tragedy when it comes to human error or mechanical failure. Unfortunately, the record is decidedly more mixed when it comes to protecting against terrorist attacks. Regardless of what caused yesterday's crash, Congress needs to assert federal control over airport security to restore confidence in the nation's commercial aviation. House Republicans must drop their ideological opposition to a federal security force at airports, so that the administration can move on to address aviation's serious vulnerabilities. Otherwise, any time a plane crashes, people's thoughts will naturally turn to terrorism.

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Slow to Grasp Government's Helping Hand 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The city and the state are giving money away to small businesses -- but almost no one is taking it.
 Some business owners cannot take it, others refuse to do so, and some may have yet to hear about it. But whatever the reason, city and state officials who work closely with New York City's small businesses say they are growing worried that too few business owners are asking for the grants and other kinds of aid that could help them recover from the Sept. 11 disaster. 
 Many owners of downtown businesses tell another story. They describe a confusing array of loans, grants and charity, with little or no coordination among the programs and agencies, piles of paperwork and differing conditions for eligibility. That confusion has left many business owners frustrated and, in essence, frozen in their tracks. 
The failure to connect sources of aid to those in need is not only surprising. It is also ominous, because it bears the seeds of an economic disaster for people in small business that could ripple from ground zero across the city and state. Companies that employ fewer than 100 people account for two of every five jobs in the city and roughly half of all jobs statewide, so a downturn among small businesses could easily cause wider economic pain.
Yet even though many small businesses in Lower Manhattan are suffering, from the effects of both the attack and the sharp economic slowdown, the agencies who work with them say they are struck by the relative lack of assistance being sought.
"I'm afraid a lot of people are holding back, not asking for help," said James L. King of the state's Small Business Development Center. "They don't know when business will return, so they've decided to wait. But to make no decision is to make a decision not to continue in business."
Asad Mahmood, a director in the community development group at Deutsche Bank, is even more blunt: "Too many downtown business owners are saying 'I don't want help; I just want the foot traffic back.' But it's not going to come back."
Some business owners say that they feel overwhelmed by the different kinds of available help, saying that there are too many local, state and federal aid programs, with little or no coordination between them.
"There's a lot of confusion and no centralized information," Meyer Feig, the owner of Intera Corporation, a three-employee computer consulting firm that was housed in 2 World Trade Center. With no files of contacts and customers and still waiting for the refund of his $12,000 security deposit on his trade center office, Mr. Feig said he has been unable to get his business going again. And until very recently, he said, "the only way to find out what is available is through a network -- if you know somebody who's gotten assistance, and you happen to hear about it."
The confusion among some business owners was evident last Wednesday, when the city's Economic Development Corporation sponsored a marketplace to introduce agencies offering financial aid to businesses in need. At the event, 16 different banks or nonprofit and governmental lending institutions were available, offering at least a half dozen different loan programs. 
Nineteen nonprofit agencies offered everything from computer and office equipment to marketing help. And 27 different real estate companies purveyed information on office space.
Nevertheless, some business people left in despair. "There's no money for us," said Lorraine Messier, a partner at New York Physical Therapy Service, a small business located on Fulton Street near Broadway, about a block from the disaster site. 
Ms. Messier said she and her business partner, Elaine Kennedy, are reluctant to offer their personal assets as collateral for a business loan, yet applying for such a loan is a requirement to get a city grant. As a partnership, their physical therapy business has few assets of its own. 
Professional service providers like physical therapists do not qualify for the state's grant program. Meanwhile, most of her customers have temporarily relocated, Ms. Messier said, and travel to her office is all but impossible for people who cannot climb subway stairs -- understandably, a substantial portion of her business. 
"We're falling through the cracks," she said. "Any amount we can get is just what we already owe," for a $1,000 cellphone bill, for example, incurred in the weeks after the isaster when telephone service was out. The office's computers were damaged by a power surge, which she says insurance will not cover, and the partners have laid off five of eight employees. 
Both the state and the city took steps last week to increase the flow of money and services to small businesses in Lower Manhattan. Discouraged with the number of companies seeking loans from the federal Small Business Administration, the Economic Development Corporation began offering $5 million in grants of up to $10,000 each to non-retail businesses that apply for a small business loan. Eligible companies who simply fill out an application will immediately get $2,500, regardless of whether the loan is ultimately approved. 
The Empire State Development Corporation is also offering $20 million in grants, also of up to $10,000 apiece, to retail and personal service businesses downtown. Those grants are available regardless of whether a company has applied for a small business loan.
Although representatives of both of those programs were at the marketplace event, a steady stream of business owners wandered from one table to another trying to navigate the requirements and specifications of the different grant programs. And the scope of the problem was made evident by the fact that while 20,000 companies were invited to the forum, only 800 showed up.
Mr. Mahmood of Deutsche Bank suggested that part of the problem was that too many political entities were interested in being seen as providing direct aid, rather than cooperating with other aid providers to help businesses. "People have to stop thinking about providing resources and think about building a concerted effort," he said.
Not all companies were so discouraged. Deepak Bawaeja, a senior vice president of Abhiyen USA, an importer and distributor of vitamins that was located on the 46th floor of 1 World Trade, praised the Economic Development Corporation program that awarded his company its first $10,000 grant. 
"This will help us buy computers," Mr. Bawaeja said. "We lost our entire database of 2,000 contract manufacturers. We're trying to contact suppliers and customers to tell them, 'Don't write us off.' " 
Now working out of donated space in Princeton, N.J., the company has now signed a lease for new offices in the Empire State Building.
Other business people have just begun to feel that help is available. City Apparel, a clothing store at Broadway and Murray Streets that specializes in women's large sizes, has few winter goods in stock, no heat in its store and in the days since its street reopened, few customers.
Yet Ying Yam Ling, the owner, left the event Wednesday in better spirits than when she arrived. "I've not gotten any help for the business yet," she said. "But I feel a lot better today. There is a lot of help here."
Michael Carey, the president of the Economic Development Corporation, said he had grown concerned that small business people were being so slow to apply for loans. 
"If you've been out of business for three weeks, you might understandably be reluctant to put your assets on the line for a loan," Mr. Carey said, explaining the reason behind the decision to tie the city's grant program to small-business loans. "But we want to help get people over the hump, and give them a comfort level that would make them more likely to take out a loan."
The city and state each doled out their first grants last week, while the Small Business Administration had distributed more than $82 million in loans through the first of November. 
Now, as the economic slowdown continues and the ripples from the World Trade Center disaster wash across the city, it is also clear that many of the business that were affected were nowhere near ground zero. Stores throughout Manhattan are feeling the pinch, as are car services in Queens. But some aid programs -- particularly the city and state grants -- are available only to Lower Manhattan businesses.
Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of Empire State Development, handed out checks for more than $75,000 in grants to small retail and personal service businesses on Thursday. One of them went to Mitchell Diamond, the owner of Unique Printing and Stationery, an office-supply store on Maiden Lane that has been in business since 1929.
Mr. Diamond said he appreciated the grant, which he might use for marketing and advertising; more helpful, however, would be incentives to get customers to buy from downtown businesses. "If we had business going on down there, we wouldn't have to worry about grants and loans."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE COMMUNITY; 
A Suburb Pulls Together For Its Grieving Families

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: MIDDLETOWN, N.J., Nov. 8 

 BODY:
A young widow with five children and a yawning mortgage, Isabel Nimbley has a lot on her mind these days. Even before her husband, Paul, perished in the rubble of the World Trade Center, her waking hours were an exhausting whirl of carpools, basketball games, meal making and parent-teacher conferences. "I'm just taking it one day at a time," she said wearily as she fed her 9-month-old son, Michael Paul, moments after her other children, ages 8 to 15, had left for school.
 Yet life goes on, and in leafy Middletown that means gutters need to be cleaned, storm windows have to be installed and pools must be closed before winter arrives. Neither tragedy, patriotism nor undeserved hardship keep the bill collectors at bay. 
 But during the past two months, Ms. Nimbley's anguish has been eased by an outpouring of generosity that has transformed this collection of single-family homes and harried self-absorption into a Normal Rockwell model of communal care-taking. A local plumber is fixing her leaky bathroom at no charge, high school students have volunteered to rake her backyard and PTA members, neighbors and strangers have been delivering dinner every night, dessert included. The owner of Amato's Karate refuses to take her money, insisting that the Nimbley children can take classes as long as they want. A 16-year-old girl came to the door recently and dropped off a plastic soda bottle stuffed with $500 she had collected from friends and relatives. She did not leave her name.
"It feels like one big family," said Ms. Nimbley, 34, a full-time mother who has yet to figure out how she will manage the $4,000 monthly mortgage and tax bill. "I've gotten so much help from strangers, I can't even keep track of it anymore." But rather than peter out, the flow of assistance has been growing stronger for the 34 families in Middletown who lost a breadwinner in the terror attacks. In fact, the philanthropic juggernaut is just getting started. 
Last month, a group of local residents formed an organization that is vowing to take over the niceties and burdens of suburban living for at least a year. The group, Middletown Favor, a loose acronym for Friends Assisting Victims of Terror, has been collecting money and asking local businesses to donate goods and services that many families, once financially stretched but now seriously strapped, are no longer be able to afford.
Allyson Gilbert, one of three women who started Favor, said she had yet to hear the word no. "It's been an amazing show of humanity," said Ms. Gilbert, a mother of three who runs a consulting business from home. "I never expected so much generosity here. Every time I turn around, someone is offering more than I even asked for."
In a few short weeks, Favor has effortlessly raised an army of working mothers (and several stay-at-home fathers) who have been cold-calling tree surgeons, house painters and chimney sweeps, asking them to adopt a family -- or all 34. The board includes Middletown's police chief, its state senator and the school superintendent, who sent the district's 10,000 students home with a Favor solicitation letter. 
One team roams the mini-malls that line Routes 35 and 36, while another works the yellow pages to hit up the landscapers, music teachers and boiler maintenance specialists who do not have storefronts. They have divvied up Middletown into walkable sections. Their goal is to knock on the door of every colonial and ranch house in this 41-square mile township and deliver the proceeds by Christmas. So far they have gathered $38,000, most of it in sums of $25. OfficeMax and Staples have been photocopying Favor's red-white-and-blue fliers, and a local businessman is providing a toll-free number, (800) 861-8736), for the group. Everything has been donated, no one gets a salary and there is no overhead. "We even take credit cards," Janet Dluhi, one of the organizers, said proudly. (Shrewsbury State Bank is processing credit card donations without charge.) Seeking to tap into their unenviable status as one of the hardest-hit communities in the region, the group is contacting every Middletown in the country -- they have found 18 so far -- proposing that each of them adopt this Monmouth County township, which lies 25 miles across New York Harbor from Lower Manhattan.
Cherished as affordable sanctuary for Wall Street comers and their growing families, Middletown has long been proud of its low crime rate, top-notch schools and quarter-acre lawns. But like many stretches of New Jersey nourished by the parkway, the turnpike and the economic bustle of New York City, the township grew so fast and willy-nilly that it has no downtown, no one place residents can call their own. 
But the public hand-wringing over sprawl and lack of identity has all but evaporated in recent weeks, replaced by the realization that the 61,000 people who live here have so much in common. Its residents are overwhelmingly white, many of them Irish- or Italian-Americans whose accents were cultivated in places like Ozone Park, Queens, or Flatbush, Brooklyn, or Staten Island. Except for the horse farms and rolling estates of Navesink River Road and Kings Highway East, it is a community dominated by two-income households that rely on long hours and credit cards to maintain a middle-class existence. 
"Even though I didn't go to one wake or memorial service, I feel like I know these people," said Annmarie Hourican, 42, a Favor volunteer who commuted to a legal assistant's job in Lower Manhattan before she became a mother. "Besides, there's only one or two degrees of separation between so many of us."
As Ms. Hourican went door to door on Twin Brooks Avenue last month asking for donations, the responses were almost always the same. People were eager to give, especially when they learned every penny would end up in the pockets of their neighbors.
"You just don't know where the Red Cross money is going," said Judy Maniaci, 34, whose husband worked at the trade center and whose brother-in-law, a firefighter, died there. "I've been looking for a way to help people here," she added, handing over a check. "I could have easily been one of these widows."
Bernadette Slavin said she donated services from her family's tree removal company because she did not want grieving survivors to worry about the mundane details of daily life. "I can picture these women waking up in the spring, looking out the window and realizing: 'He's not around anymore. Where do I begin?' " she said. "We want to make sure everyone is taken care of, at least make their lives a little easier until some normalcy returns."
To city dwellers, the growing list of donated services might seem frivolous. Dr. Jeff Knecht, a chiropractor, is offering free adjustments, Dairy Queen is giving each family a six-inch cake, and Kindercuts will be providing haircuts to the 40 or so children who lost a parent.
But for Ramona Schroeder, who is struggling to raise two grandchildren, ages 13 and 10, on a dental assistant's salary, every little bit helps.
"I just want to make sure the kids have the life they had before," said Mrs. Schroeder, whose daughter, Lorraine Del Carmen Antigua, 32, was a single mother and bond trader for Cantor Fitzgerald. "I don't want their world to change any more than it already has."
That will clearly be a challenge for Mrs. Schroeder and her husband, Charles, a retired New York City police officer originally from Queens. The Schroeders, who drove up from their home in Florida on Sept. 11 to take care of the grandchildren, are now responsible for an additional $3,000 in monthly expenses, including the mortgage on their daughter's three-bedroom home and the maintenance on her above-ground swimming pool.
Mrs. Schroeder knows it will be a struggle. The bank has already repossessed her daughter's Toyota Avalon, and she recently received a foreclosure notice from the mortgage company. (A local charity later agreed to pay the overdue months.) "Their mother worked so hard to give them everything," she said. "I'd hate for them to lose it."

HEADLINE: THE CRASH OF FLIGHT 587: THE AIRLINE; 
Crash Inflicts Heavy Blow On Prospects Of American

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Before Flight 587 fell from the sky yesterday, American Airlines was seen as one of the carriers best positioned to weather the drastic downturn that followed September's terrorist attacks. But now American could find itself in much deeper trouble, experts said yesterday.
 "The question in my mind is whether this now makes it harder for American to recover relative to the rest of the industry," said David Newkirk, the head of the travel industry consulting practice at Booz Allen & Hamilton. 
 Donald J. Carty, the chief executive of American's parent, the AMR Corporation, seemed to telegraph that message in his public comments yesterday. 
"Today's news comes at a difficult time for the nation, a difficult time for the airline industry and a very difficult time for American Airlines," Mr. Carty said at a news conference at the company's Fort Worth headquarters. "Given the changed world we live in today, it will be as important as it has ever been to quickly and to accurately determine the cause of this accident."
A new terrorist attack would probably cause passenger traffic to plunge again and raise questions about whether American, which lost two planes on Sept. 11, was being singled out because of its name. 
But even if the crash turns out to be an accident -- the best that American can hope for -- the carrier could be severely harmed. American has had a higher number of fatal accidents than its competitors in recent years. Another one could harden the impression that the airline has a safety problem. 
Investors immediately punished the company and other airline stocks. AMR stock fell as much as 17 percent today, to a low of $15.10, but recovered to close down 9 percent, at $16.49. 
Consumer confidence in air travel has been recovering with the approach of the holidays, and early indications were that few travelers were rushing to cancel flights after yesterday's crash. Hal Rosenbluth, the chief executive of Rosenbluth International, the country's third-largest travel agency, said that the booking patterns of most of his large corporate clients did not change significantly yesterday. 
But he and most analysts say that the crash will deliver a blow to an industry that has been losing tens of millions of dollars a day since September's attacks. "Even if it is an accident, it still will dry up demand," said Kevin C. Murphy, the airline analyst at Morgan Stanley. "It makes an unbelievably bad situation even worse."
After the terrorist attacks, American, along with other airlines, cut thousands of jobs and reduced its flight schedule. To conserve cash, American has slashed its capital spending plans, closed ticket offices and airport lounges and stopped serving meals on most flights. 
But the airline, which became the world's largest earlier this year after acquiring the ailing Trans World Airlines, has not been able to stanch the flow of red ink. Last month, American said that it was losing $10 million to $15 million a day, about the same sum as its major rival, United Airlines.
Still, before yesterday, American's situation was not nearly as dire as that of some other airlines. Long known for the financial acumen of its executives, American has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. At the end of September, it had $2.3 billion in cash and $8 billion in airplanes and other assets that it could borrow against. It was one of the few airlines that experts predicted would not need to apply for federally guaranteed loans extended to the industry after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
American said yesterday that it would allow passengers to postpone travel without penalty, a decision that will hurt its finances more than rival carriers with less liberal policies.
When the two American jetliners that were hijacked in September and flown into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon are included, the crash of Flight 587 brings to five the number of planes the airline has lost since 1995. In December of that year, pilot error caused one of its Boeing 757's to fly into a mountain near Cali, Colombia, killing 160 passengers and crew. In June 1999, an American MD-80 slid off the runway in Little Rock, Ark., killing 11 and injuring 105. 
Trying to restore public confidence last week, Mr. Carty made a statement that has been echoed by every major airline chief executive of late. "I think being on an airplane is probably one of the safest places to be," he said. Mr. Carty flew to New York on Monday afternoon to meet with officials and the families of those who died in the crash in Queens.

HEADLINE: SPORTS BUSINESS; 
Developing a Winning Team Should Be Preferred to Closing the Books

BYLINE:  By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
Remember when the Cleveland Indians were a major league joke? 
 When its ownership seemed to turn over annually and hardly anyone filled old Cleveland Stadium? 
 Now it is a bedrock franchise, a perennial contender that plays in the perpetually sold-out Jacobs Field.
But had contraction been contemplated a decade or so ago, the Indians might be extinct. 
Cleveland's former tale of woe looks remarkably like that of the Minnesota Twins, who are said to be on Major League Baseball's contraction hit list, along with the Montreal Expos.
The Twins have languished in the 13th-largest television market (larger than No. 15 Cleveland) as a small-revenue team in the moribund Metrodome. Its owner, Carl Pohlad, is a billionaire banker whose maneuverings to sell the team to a North Carolina buyer and to get Minnesota taxpayers to build him a stadium have made him as beloved as Mr. Potter in "It's a Wonderful Life." In 1997, his proposed contribution to the stadium's cost turned out to be a loan the state would have to repay.
"He wasn't greatly reviled or hated until that," said Bill Lester, the executive director of the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, the Metrodome's landlord.
Twins fans are no more invisible now than Indians fans once were, provided the team is competitive. The Twins' attendance pattern -- between 1.05 million and 1.4 million between 1994 and 2000 -- echoes that of the Indians' before Jacobs Field was built in Cleveland. With a good team this season, the Twins drew 1.78 million, 70 percent more than last year.
In 1993, the year before the Jake opened, the slowly improving Indians drew 2.17 million fans, up 78 percent from the year before.
"If you draw nearly two million in a bad stadium, what do you draw in a good one?" said Clark Griffith, a Minneapolis lawyer whose father, Calvin, sold the Twins to Pohlad in 1984. On behalf of an investor group, Griffith has tried to buy the team, most recently for about $100 million. But Pohlad refused to sell.
Griffith said: "This is a situation where none of the elements for contraction exist. This isn't hopeless."
During Pohlad's reign, the Twins won two World Series. This season, they led the American League Central division for a time.
Is this a team worth buying out of existence? Or should baseball broker the sale of the team to a billionaire who has not generated public enmity and who could better plead a stadium financing plan with the legislature and Gov. Jesse Ventura?
"What we need here is a relief pitcher to get the stadium deal done," Griffith said.
Contraction may provide savings, but it would be costly, too. The remaining 28 teams would get more national TV, licensing and international money. And the drain of revenue sharing might be eased with Montreal gone.
But buying out the teams alone could cost at least $325 million, prices that the clubs would surely try to negotiate upward. (But baseball should not offer a cent more than the most conservative values set for the clubs. It is not as if there is competition.) The money would have to be borrowed, then repaid with network TV money.
"The bargaining chip that a contracted team owner has is that however much or little the Expos are worth in Montreal, Jeff Loria can argue in court that he could move his franchise to another market that would build him a new stadium," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College, who has consulted for the baseball players' union. "In that market, it's worth $250 million, or maybe $300 million in Washington."
Zimbalist suggested that baseball should not worry about a threat by Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' owner, to sue baseball if a team moves to northern Virginia. 
"As I read the rules and regulations, he has a 75-mile territorial radius in his league but not outside his league," Zimbalist said. 
Contraction is a strange business. Everywhere else, contraction is called downsizing. Companies lay off workers, close plants and shut franchises. Why should baseball be immune to the forces of capitalism?
"But a car company wouldn't shut down a plant in the face of increasing business," said Zimbalist, who cited healthy increases in baseball's overall revenues.
Of course, the baseball union opposes contraction, and its past success and legal wiliness indicate that it could throw a roadblock in the plan.
"Generally, the employer retains control over decisions to shut down facilities," said Richard Hurd, a labor studies professor at Cornell. "Unions generally don't have the power to stop shutdowns. It depends on their power and whether they have negotiated limits to a company's ability to downsize."
While baseball imitates other industries by trying to close its shops in Minnesota and Montreal, it is hoping Loria takes his contraction cash and buys the Florida Marlins, who have little chance of getting public financing for a new stadium. And it hopes John Henry, the Marlins' owner, buys the Angels, who are no bargain, either.
They, too, would incur capital gains taxes on selling their teams, unless some type of complex tax-free exchange can be worked out.
In baseball capitalism, these nouveau owners who miscalculated on their first-team purchases get a chance at losing money elsewhere.
However the contraction musical chairs end, the lesson in trying to eliminate teams is that more revenue sharing is needed. Minnesota could have been baseball's Green Bay, a market that might not be as endemically strong as New York but still worthy of survival.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: A NEW DAY; 
U.S. and Partners Quickly Set Sights on a Post-Taliban Kabul

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
The United States and the countries most closely affected by developments in Afghanistan called today for "broad-based, multiethnic, politically balanced, freely chosen Afghan administration" to take charge once the Taliban is totally driven from Kabul.
 The goal, issued in a statement by a group known here as "Six plus Two" -- the United States and Russia plus China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, became more urgent tonight with the news that the Taliban had withdrawn from Kabul. The group met with the special United Nations envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, who returned last week after a tour of the region and whose mission the group formally endorsed. 
 As rebel forces advanced on Kabul during the day, an added sense of immediacy surrounded the deliberations, at which Secretary of State Colin L. Powell represented Washington. 
After the meeting, Mr. Brahimi said he would try to convene "a representative sample of the Afghan population together and see what kind of interim arrangements can work together for Kabul."
There was no immediate information when or where the meeting might be held.
The Bush administration's special envoy to the Afghan opposition, James F. Dobbins, was reported on his way to Europe and Central Asia to work toward a post-Taliban government.
"As things are moving very fast, we need to bring the political aspects in line with the military development on the ground," Secretary General Kofi Annan said. "We have to be nimble. We have to be able to move quickly, and we have to be flexible, and I think we are at the stage when the nimbleness is going to come into play."
Secretary Powell's message to the group, a diplomat said, was "speed, speed, speed." Diplomats also noted that the secretary shook hands with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, an act that was considered in itself a significant step forward in relations that have been officially frozen since the Iranian revolution of 1979.
The meeting of the "Six plus Two" was one of several today at which foreign ministers and ambassadors at the General Assembly, their nerves taut after reports of the jetliner crash in Queens, wrestled with the increasingly urgent demands of the two-month-old war on terrorism.
The report that a plane had crashed near Kennedy Airport sent an instant shudder through the heavily guarded United Nations headquarters on the East River.
For about an hour, the smoke from the crash was clearly visible. Diplomats and bureaucrats stood transfixed at television screens, wondering whether this was another terror attack.
Access to the building was shut down for a short while, but security officials ruled against evacuating the headquarters or interrupting the General Assembly. The only known disruption was the failure of the Pakistani foreign minister to attend the morning meeting on Afghanistan.
The Security Council also met to endorse earlier United Nations resolutions requiring all 189 member states to take action in cutting the funding to terror groups. Though the resolution broke no new ground, diplomats said its importance lay in reaffirming the earlier actions at the level of foreign ministers.
One small but noteworthy advance came in Secretary Powell's address, when he said that the war on terrorism should also be fought "with increased support for democracy programs, judicial reform, conflict resolution, poverty alleviation, economic reform and health and education programs."
The large majority of speakers at the General Assembly have stressed that any campaign on terrorism must also include an assault on its causes, while the American tendency has been to focus solely on eradicating terror organizations.
President Bush, in his address to the United Nations on Saturday, dismissed any attempt to justify terrorism, declaring, "There is no such thing as a good terrorist."
Some diplomats saw in Secretary Powell's comments an American attempt to soften that stance.
The whirl of diplomacy also took place on the periphery of the General Assembly.
President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, who has been active in and around the United Nations, said at a breakfast with reporters that it was for the United States to take the first "practical steps" to restore relations with Iran. One of these, he said, might be to stop trying to find a pipeline route for Caspian Sea oil that would avoid Iran. "I am confident that if practical steps are taken, we will have a more positive framework," Mr. Khatami said.
The president, whose tenure has been marked by complex maneuvering between his moderate supporters and the militant clerics who wield considerable power in Iran, said his policies had resulted in improved relations in the region and in Europe.
Mr. Khatami, who has repeatedly condemned the attacks on the World Trade Center in strong terms, was challenged on the Iranian support for militant Islamic groups like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah.
His response followed the arguments presented by many Arabic governments at the General Assembly, which sought to draw a distinction between Osama bin Laden and "resistance movements."
"The actions of Jihad and Hamas are being done to protect their land," he said. "Hezbollah pushed Israel out of southern Lebanon, and has not been involved in any terrorist act in the four years I have been in office, except fighting occupation forces.
"You see, this is our problem -- who defines terrorism and who is a terrorist?"
That, in fact, was the main problem the General Assembly was underscoring in the debate, and which has stymied the drafting of an anti-terrorism treaty for more than a year now.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FUTURE; 
Powell Says Muslim Nations Should Be Peacekeepers in Kabul; 3 Offer Troops

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

 BODY:
Hours before the first reports that the Taliban appeared to be moving out of the Afghan capital, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said yesterday that it might soon be necessary to send an international "coalition of the willing," led by soldiers from Muslim nations, to secure the capital and prepare the ground for an interim government.
 "There is a general deterioration of the Taliban military position," Secretary Powell said in an interview with The New York Times. "Once you start something like this, it tends to start rolling, and they can't stop it." 
 He said he expected advancing Northern Alliance forces to mass north of the capital, Kabul, within 24 hours. Soon after he spoke came the first reports that the Taliban were leaving. 
Secretary Powell said Turkey, Bangladesh and Indonesia (whose people are predominantly Muslim) have offered forces for an operation that would buttress a "bridging political structure" under United Nations control.
He excluded the deployment of Americans in this force, saying it would be better to have Muslim countries "than one of the big-power nations coming in to do it."
The secretary indicated that President Bush and his advisers had marshaled the administration's contingency planning around how to employ such a force with a United Nations presence until a broad-based group of Afghan leaders could be assembled to form a government. 
"Things are moving much more rapidly now than we had anticipated just a week ago," Secretary Powell said, adding that help from American Special Forces on the ground was paying off.
"We've got a first-world air force connected to a fourth-world army -- B-1 bombers and guys on horses," he said of the Northern Alliance, "and what we have done in the last five weeks is sort of connect those two." 
A still critical factor is the Taliban's hold on southern Afghanistan, and the secretary expressed frustration over the failure thus far to mobilize a rebellion or orchestrate defections of prominent local leaders in the region, where the majority Pashtuns have mostly refused to break with the Taliban. 
Many potential defectors are under military guard by Taliban forces, he added.
Pakistan could also do more to undermine Taliban control, he said.
He added that the United States has a number of covert operations under way. He declined to describe them in detail, but said they were intended to foment a weakening of the Taliban's control of the center and south of Afghanistan.
These, he said, were "special sorts of operations to encourage activity in the south that would not be in the best interest of the Taliban."
The proposal for the large-scale intervention of foreign forces was the centerpiece of debates yesterday in the United Nations General Assembly and among delegates from the six nations that border Afghanistan, plus the United States and Russia. 
This so-called Six-Plus-Two Group endorsed international efforts to fight terrorism, "in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations." 
"As things are moving very fast, we need to bring the political aspects in line with the military development on the ground," Secretary General Kofi Annan told reporters after a closed-door conference where Secretary Powell was said to have urged great speed in planning international intervention. 
Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria, the United Nations envoy working to galvanize the Afghan opposition to the Taliban, emerged from the conference to say, "We are going to try as soon as possible to get hopefully a representative sample of the Afghan population together and see what kind of interim arrangements we can work together for Kabul."
Though Secretary Powell had suggested that Pakistan could do more in Afghanistan, he praised Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the president, and said he judges him to be "in a secure position." He said the Bush administration was likely to develop a "robust military-to-military" relationship with both Pakistan and India while trying to freeze nuclear development in both countries. 
In an aside, the secretary referred to General Musharraf's requests for American gestures to recognize Pakistan for its cooperation. He said that as he was leaving Pakistan last month, after conversations with General Musharraf about textile trade and debt relief, he told the Pakistani leader: "General, I've got it right here across my forehead, two words: 'debt relief.' Say no more." 
Secretary Powell made it clear that within the Bush administration, the debate over whether to use persuasion or force in southern Afghanistan had not been resolved. The accused terrorist Osama bin Laden is thought to be in hiding in the south, and the Taliban has its stronghold there, at Kandahar.
Though military pressure may be necessary in the south, he said, the momentum of victory by the Northern Alliance and the food, medicine and hope it could bring to the north could inspire Pashtun leaders to accelerate the eventual collapse of Taliban control in the south. 
These tasks, he said, would not divert the administration from its overall goal of destroying Al Qaeda, the network led by Mr. bin Laden.
"The president will never, never step away from the goal of finding bin Laden and ripping up Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and all the other places where it located," he said. 
He said he did not know where Mr. Bin Laden was but added: "I can assure you that every day a great deal of attention is focused on where he might be. He is on the run now."
Speaking with his characteristic self-confidence, Secretary Powell asserted that President Bush is overcoming criticism that the administration had charted a unilateral course in foreign policy by withdrawing or threatening to withdraw from treaties and generally conveying the sense that Washington prefers to go it alone, rather than be encumbered by collective security arrangements. 
The secretary said that in the Middle East, the administration had absorbed the lesson that "unless there the hope of negotiations, the hope of a political track to move toward solutions" in the long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, "you always have the problem of rolling back down the hill to violence."
He also acknowledged the centrality of the issue to Arab leaders, saying it was necessary to "remove the level of humiliation that exists in the region," reflected in Palestinian grievances, which increase anxiety and aggravate violence.
Insisting that there was direction and movement in Middle East policy, the secretary noted that President Bush referred Saturday in his speech to the General Assembly to his vision of a state called Palestine -- and caused no great stir. Secretary Powell's own use of the word six months ago triggered an uproar.
In his own address on terrorism to the General Assembly, Secretary Powell said the international community had an obligation to find solutions to conflicts that give rise to terrorism. 
"But the war on terrorism starts within each of our respective sovereign borders," he said. "It will be fought with increased support for democracy programs, judicial reform, conflict resolution, poverty alleviation, economic reform and health and education programs. All of these together deny the reason for terrorists to exist or to find safe havens within those borders."
Secretary Powell also said in the interview that President Bush is preparing to enter the Middle East peace effort more directly.
"We are still looking for an opportunity to put down a comprehensive statement of what the U.S. stands for," he said, referring to Mr. Bush's pledges to work for a settlement that would establish both a Palestinian state and secure borders for Israel. He gave no timetable.
When Mr. Bush "sees progress, he will become more engaged than he is now," the secretary said.
He praised Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for showing restraint in recent weeks, and he urged the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, to work harder to quell Palestinian violence so a cease-fire can pave the way to a return to the negotiating table.
Secretary Powell said that while he was not aware of any intelligence information connecting Iraq to the Sept. 11 attacks, contacts in Prague between an Iraqi intelligence officer and one of the hijackers, Mohamed Atta, were a source of concern.
"I can assure you that if there are links out there that we can find and should chase, we will chase them," he said. "There is a high level of interest in what Iraq may be doing in this field because they remain committed to pursuing the development of weapons of mass destruction."

HEADLINE: THE CRASH OF FLIGHT 587: THE VICTIMS; 
Grief Echoes From New York to Santo Domingo

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW and MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Several times a day, the flights depart from Kennedy Airport, providing a crucial link between the Dominican Republic and New York City's Dominican neighborhoods. The first flight out, American Airlines Flight 587 to Santo Domingo, is so familiar that some Dominicans talk about it as if it were the morning train. With holidays approaching, Flight 587 was packed.
 Tito Baustita, 37, who worked in a factory by day and a bodega by night, was heading home to visit two sons. Angela de la Cruz, 38, who made the trip every few months, was returning with her father to sell a house. Ivelisse Taveras, 42, a Washington Heights hairdresser, left her two children with relatives to visit her husband. Felix Sanchez, a Merrill Lynch employee who worked in the World Trade Center but was lucky on Sept. 11, was on his way to visit family in Santo Domingo. 
 But at 9:17 a.m., the link home was severed in horrifying fashion. Dominicans in two distant cities, joined by culture, family and commerce, suddenly had grief to share, too. 
In Santo Domingo, hundreds packed the Las Americas International Airport, normally the setting for joyful reunions. Some relatives collapsed, hands shaking uncontrollably. Others wept, inconsolable.
In Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan, the hub of Dominican culture in New York, residents shared their grief on street corners and at lunch counters. In some places they set up sidewalk memorials, lighting candles and laying bouquets. At a social service agency on Amsterdam Avenue near 180th Street, Carlos Lora, 33, said he only wanted to find the body of his 3-year-old son, Karl Steven Lora, who, with his grandmother, had been on Flight 587.
"I just want to be able to bury him," Mr. Lora said.
Officials said that 260 people were on Flight 587, and by some early estimates 150 to 175 of the passengers were thought to be Dominicans. "Dominicans who live in New York do not in any way sever their ties with the Dominican Republic," said Kirk Bullington, a Baptist missionary there to console families. "They are as much part of Dominican life as if they lived here."
Luis Eludis Perez, consul general of the Dominican Republic, searched for words yesterday to describe his emotions and then gave up. "The pain is too big," he said yesterday at his offices in Manhattan.
Throughout the day, in frantic phone calls and e-mail messages, friends and relatives separated by an ocean tried to learn whether loved ones had been on the flight. With some phone lines jammed, it took several hours for government officials in Santo Domingo to contact the consulate in New York. There were initial fears that high-ranking officials might have been on the flight, returning from the United Nations General Assembly. But by late afternoon, most had been located. 
For many, though, the news was almost too much to bear. In Santo Domingo, one man, a customs officer on duty at the airport, fainted upon learning that his wife and children were on the flight.
Freddy Beras Boyco, a Dominican television personality, said he had confirmation that Papi La Fontaine, a show business impresario who lived in New York, and Norma Guzman Valoy, the daughter of a famous singer, Cuco Valoy, were on the doomed flight. Ms. Valoy was traveling home with her three children.
Although no official list of the dead had been released last night, Guillermo Linares, a City Council member who represents Washington Heights, said that he dreaded the toll this crash would surely exact on his community. The terror attacks on Sept. 11 killed 41 Dominicans, he said. The effect of yesterday's disaster, he predicted, will be nothing less than devastating. He was referring to the human cost, but there were also fears of an economic loss. The crash comes as the Dominican Republic is struggling to recover from a steep decline in tourism after Sept. 11. The resulting hotel closings and layoffs prompted President Hipolito Mejia to commit more than $20 million for tourism marketing.
Indeed, Aurora Martinez, a 62-year-old factory worker, was a reluctant passenger on Flight 587. "After Sept. 11, she was a little afraid to fly," said her son, Victor Caceres. "She didn't want to go, but she had to sell the property." Mr. Caceres kissed his mother, hugged her and told her: "I'll call you in four or five hours. You should be there by then."
The Sept. 11 attacks had also made Oneida Mercedes Acosta, 42, who worked seven days a week at a beauty salon in the Bronx, a reluctant passenger. "She was always afraid of planes," said her brother, Hervio Mendoza, 37. 
"This year it was worse."
But the annual trip back to Santo Domingo, to five of her brothers and sisters and countless friends, was always a high point of her year. So she went, taking her two children, Giovanni, 22, and Wendy, 26. "I went to her house last night to say goodbye," Mr. Mendoza said, his eyes welling up.
Mr. Mendoza looked for help, and solace, to Alianza Dominicana, a social services agency that went into full throttle as soon as the news of the crash spread. As mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers wept to guidance counselors inside, neighbors lit candles and brought flowers to a small memorial outside. "Estamos de Luto," or We are in Mourning, a banner read.
Cid Wilson dropped by to see what he could do. He said that the friend he lost, Mr. Sanchez, 29, the Merrill Lynch employee, "was a true example of what's gone right in this community." Mr. Wilson said that they had met in a group called Dominicans on Wall Street. "This was way before his prime," he said.
Flights like 587 form a kind of air bridge to the Dominican Republic, allowing many Dominican immigrants to keep up with their lives in both countries. Along some stretches of Broadway in Washington Heights, small travel agencies can be found on almost every other block, advertising cheap fares and offering services that range from wiring money to the Caribbean to doing income taxes to processing divorces, in some cases. Travel agents in Washington Heights said that even as the rest of the airplane industry has suffered in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, flights to the Dominican Republic were often full, in part because people who felt shaken by the disaster at the World Trade Center longed to see their relatives and in part because they longed to escape the city for a while.
There have been reports of parents taking their children out of school in New York and sending them back to the Dominican Republic, where they felt safer.
Mr. Bullington said he spoke with the brother of one passenger who had just recently decided to leave New York for good. "The guy said to me that his brother had not been back in three years, but that he was making this trip to buy land to move his family back to the Dominican Republic because of what had happened on Sept. 11," Mr. Bullington said. "He perished most likely, along with his baby son who was with him."
Gladys Basora, a manager of the EZ Vision travel agency on Broadway near 207th Street, told a similar story about a longtime customer who was on Flight 587. "He was scared by Sept. 11, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to stay here any longer," she said. "He was making the trip to see if he could go back to stay. He told me, 'I would rather live on a farm.' "
But instead, relatives in both countries were left wondering whether terrorism had now touched them, too, despite early indications from officials that mechanical failure was a more likely cause of the crash.
At the Ramada Plaza Hotel near Kennedy Airport, some relatives gathered at a family center set up by the authorities. Families absorbed the news that charred bodies were being recovered on the streets of Rockaway, some still strapped into their seats.
Last night, in front of the Ramada, Genaro Moran stood holding a photograph of his brother, Francisco Diaz, a taxi driver who was returning to the Dominican Republic to visit his wife and two children. 
As for many other Dominicans in New York, the trip home for Mr. Diaz was a chance to shower gifts on relatives, proof of his hard labors in a cold country.
"He worked every day, to have enough money to bring his family here," Mr. Moran said. "Just last night, he was saying how happy he was to be going to see them."
In Santo Domingo, officials also set up a family center, this one behind a blue plastic curtain on the second floor of the main airport terminal. By late afternoon, only a few dozen relatives remained at the airport, where two people had to be taken away by ambulance for medical care. 
Even as the Dominican government declared three days of official mourning, mental health workers and Red Cross volunteers streamed into the airport, some carrying boxes of food.
"This is a great hurt for the Dominican Republic and the United States," said Vice President Milagros Ortiz Bosch. "I want to say to Mayor Giuliani, 'We are in solidarity now more than ever.' "

HEADLINE: G.M. Starts to Back Off on Its Price War 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
General Motors has begun a slow retreat from the auto industry's price war that was spurred by the Sept. 11 attacks.
 G.M., the nation's largest automaker, said today that it would extend its Keep America Rolling incentive package and continue to offer interest-free financing through Jan. 2. But the new phase of the plan will be less generous than the current one and will not include Cadillacs, Corvettes and some Saturn vehicles. 
 Beginning Nov. 19, interest-free financing will be offered only on three-year purchase plans, which are less attractive to many buyers than four- and five-year deals because they have overall lower monthly payments. Interest-free deals will continue to be restricted to customers with good credit ratings.
And financing rates on four- and five-year deals will rise. For instance, four-year deals on 2002 pickups will carry rates of 3.9 percent, instead of the current 2.9 percent.
G.M. started offering interest-free financing deals on its entire vehicle lineup when sales fell sharply after the Sept. 11 attacks. Company executives said they were trying to do their part to stimulate the flagging economy. But they also saw a chance to gain market share while they had a newer lineup of sport utility vehicles and trucks than their chief rivals, Ford Motor and the Chrysler Group.
Ford and Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, unenthusiastically followed with their own interest-free financing plans, which are set to end this month, and some foreign automakers have also offered limited deals. As a result, sales of cars and trucks in this country surged in October to the highest monthly level in the auto industry's history.
Analysts, however, worry that the sales boom came at the expense of profits. Last month, incentive costs for the Big Three carmakers rose to an average of $2,744 per vehicle, up 67.5 percent from the month a year earlier, according to a recent report by UBS Warburg.
"I think G.M. overreacted about the impact of the events of Sept. 11 and put in incentives that were too generous," said David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities.
He and most other analysts expect the record sales to be short-lived.
"It's a question of when they're going to give up this artificial volume, take the hit and see where the real bottom is," said Scott Sprinzen, the managing director for automotive credit at Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, which recently downgraded the credit ratings of the Big Three.
"I don't view it as a positive in any sense," he said of today's announcement, though he added, "It is good news, maybe, that they're being more selective."
Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director for global market and industry analysis, said sales had already slowed from October's record pace. The rollback of incentives is likely to cause that trend to continue, even if it makes each individual vehicle more profitable.
Keep America Rolling "is a very expensive program," Mr. Ballew said. "We need to transition down, and this is one way of doing it."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DRUG MAKERS; 
Antibiotics Business Is Again Popular

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
Like other pharmaceutical companies, Eli Lilly & Company rushed late last month to offer the government help in fighting bioterrorism. It volunteered to increase production of its antibiotics and even to allow its plants to be used to produce antibiotics made by other manufacturers. 
 Lilly could make the offer because it has excess capacity in its antibiotics plants, a spokesman said. Once a giant in that part of the pharmaceuticals business, the company, based in Indianapolis, has scaled back the development of antibacterial drugs to focus on what it saw as richer opportunities, like drugs for psychological disorders and osteoporosis. 
 Lilly is not alone. The pharmaceuticals industry, convinced that antibiotics had already vanquished most bugs, de-emphasized development of new antibiotics over the last two decades, leading to a dearth of new drugs to fight bacterial infections. Antibiotic sales, about $24 billion worldwide, declined 1 percent last year, according to a report by Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. Drug sales over all rose about 10 percent, according to IMS Health, a health care information company.
Still, the need for new antibiotics has been increasing. Bacteria that cause everything from tuberculosis to hospital infections have been evolving to be resistant to existing antibiotics, at times turning what were routine infections into potentially life-threatening illnesses. 
Now, fears of bioterrorism may lead more companies to develop new drugs to fight bacterial infections. Martin Rosenberg, who recently retired after leading research on infectious-disease drugs at GlaxoSmithKline, said, "It's certainly made people aware that there are issues around the fact that the number of drugs we have against micro-organisms is relatively small and shrinking." 
Several young biotechnology companies and a few big drug makers are turning to a new tool -- genomics -- to unravel the inner workings of bacteria and devise new ways to attack them. 
Among the reasons that making antibiotics has been out of favor is that these drugs are taken for a few days, while drugs for conditions like high blood pressure and arthritis may be taken for life.
And despite bacterial resistance, older antibiotics like penicillin and tetracycline still work for many infections, limiting the demand for new drugs. 
"If the drugs that are out there are good enough for 80 to 90 percent of infections, why bother to have major research on infections?" said Neil Sweig, pharmaceuticals analyst at Ryan, Beck & Company.
The Food and Drug Administration is contemplating rule changes that would make it harder for antibiotics to win approval, possibly discouraging development. But Dr. Mark Goldberger, acting director of the F.D.A. office that reviews antibiotics, said no decision had been made and the agency was also looking at changes that would ease the way for some drugs to be approved. 
Scientific factors also limit the appeal of research on antibiotics. Most antibiotics are chemicals produced by bacteria or fungi to kill rival microbes and have been found by sifting soil samples. But it has become harder to find new chemicals this way. So companies have concentrated on modifying existing drugs to develop variations that are more potent, or work against a broader range of bugs and are different enough to patent. 
"In many cases the compounds were me-too's," said Julian Davies, a microbiology professor at the University of British Columbia and executive vice president of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company in Lexington, Mass.
Some industry executives and analysts say there is little incentive to develop antibiotics just to treat biological terror agents, despite the recent boom in the sales of the Bayer drug Cipro. Sales of such drugs, they maintain, will be sporadic and small, especially compared with drugs used to treat common infections that affect millions of people each year. 
"Bioterrorism at this point in time is a short-term business opportunity," said George F. Horner III, chief executive of Versicor Inc., a biotechnology company in Fremont, Calif., that is developing antibiotics. "We're not interested in fads." 
Despite these limitations, a big-selling antibiotic can have sales of more than $1 billion a year. The world's best-selling antibiotic, Augmentin from GlaxoSmithKline, had sales exceeding $1.8 billion last year, making it the industry's 14th-best-selling drug over all, according to Mr. Sweig. Cipro, the first brand-name antibiotic to be specifically approved to treat inhaled anthrax, was Bayer's biggest-selling drug last year, with revenue around $1.6 billion. 
Much of the new research is aimed at understanding the inner workings of bacteria. The complete DNA sequences are now available for more than 50 strains of bacteria. The hope is that such work will lead to many new ways to attack bacteria. 
"If you take the known antibiotics in the world, they are against 30 different molecular targets within various bacteria and fungal pathogens," said Harry Hixson, chief executive of Elitra Pharmaceuticals, a privately held biotechnology company in San Diego. 
Elitra is systematically inactivating genes in various pathogens. If blocking a gene kills the bug, then that gene is deemed essential for bacterial survival and could be a target for a drug. Late last month, the company licensed some of the targets it had discovered to Merck & Company.
Other companies are already aiming at certain aspects of bacterial behavior. Essential Therapeutics of Waltham, Mass., which until a merger last month was known as Microcide Pharmaceuticals, is trying to design drugs to disable tiny pumps that bacteria use to eject antibiotics. 
Microbia, a privately held company in Cambridge, Mass., is focusing on blocking bacteria and fungi from forming slimy films that coat surfaces. 
Yet no antibiotics using genomics have entered clinical trials, and the first new antibiotics that will come out of the biotechnology industry will probably have been derived or descended from discoveries made the traditional way, in soil. 
These include Cubist's daptomycin, which is in the final stages of clinical trial. Versicor is also in the final phase of trials for anidulafungin, which it says would be the second drug in a new class of antifungal drugs. InterMune of Brisbane, Calif., is in late-stage tests of oritavancin, a new version of vancomycin.
All three drugs have something in common -- they were discovered by Eli Lilly, which decided not to develop them as it concentrated on what it saw as better opportunities.

American Airlines Faces Problems From Plane Crash
Before Flight 587 crashed, American Airlines was seen as one of the carriers best positioned to weather the drastic downturn that came after September's terrorist attacks. But now -- depending on what is determined to have caused the crash -- American could find itself in much deeper trouble, experts said.
 The best that American can hope for is that the crash turns out to be an accident, and even then it could be severely harmed. American has had a higher number of fatal accidents than its competitors in recent years. Another one could harden the impression that the airline has a safety problem. Investors punished the company's stock, sending its shares down $1.64, or 9 percent, to $16.49. Page D10.

HEADLINE: Tibet's Quiet Protest 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "China's Upbeat Governor in Tibet Promises Investment" (news article, Nov. 7):
 The Chinese government clearly -- and misguidedly -- hopes that increased investment in Tibet will discourage Tibetan nationalism. 
 Although Tibetans have been kept poor by discriminatory Chinese policies, their primary grievance is not economic but rather the occupation of their country by a foreign army. Suppression of dissent, economic policies intended to encourage Han immigration, and severe restrictions on the practice of religion only add insult to injury.
It would be wise of the American government to pressure China more actively to negotiate with the Dalai Lama and end human rights abuses in Tibet. If we wish to combat terrorism worldwide, we must show that nonviolent resistance is a more effective way to command world attention.

HEADLINE: On Eve of Putin Visit, Red Belt Sees Greenbacks 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: TULA, Russia 

 BODY:
They call this region south of Moscow the Red Belt, because of its fealty to Communist leadership. But these days when talk turns to Russia's newly warm relations with America, dollar signs seem to glow in people's eyes and words like "credits, investment, joint ventures" spill off their tongues.
 "We need the money," said a woman who gave only her first name, Tamara, and her age, 53, as she sold hats and gloves at an outdoor bazaar just off Leninsky Prospekt, hoping to supplement the $100 a month her husband earns at a factory making hunting guns. "Putin promised that soon we'll live a happy life here. We've been waiting a long time." 
 As Russian President Vladimir V. Putin heads to President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., for what some here call a "summit without ties," military topics will be high on the agenda. But for most people here, America matters much more as an economic superpower than as a military one.
Not everyone likes America, or welcomes America's war on terrorism and the presence of American troops in former Soviet republics like Uzbekistan, or, for that matter, the invasion of American culture. But everyone seems to agree that, economically at least, Russia needs all the American good will it can get.
"Just look around and you will see -- Russia is lagging behind," said Anatoly Ivanovich, 51, a jewelry vendor who left a factory job because it did not pay enough to live.
Or, as Anatoly Gololabenkov, a 60-year-old businessman, put it: "We're not as rich as we used to be."
For good or ill, America's influence is felt most here as a producer of the goods, like Nike and Adidas, advertised almost everywhere; as a creator of employment through joint ventures like the one Procter & Gamble has in a nearby town; even as a source of unemployment, when managers at a local steel factory blamed American quotas for laying off 1,500 workers.
Negotiations on the missile treaty are weighed largely for their economic repercussions.
Sergei G. Volkov, a former policeman who now manages the city's municipal markets, said if the United States went ahead with a missile shield, Russia -- which he called a "country of paupers" -- would have to compete. "We're not afraid of attack," he said, "but of another spiral of the arms race that could make us even poorer."
Tula was once a famous center of gunsmithing -- Peter the Great put a small arms factory here in 1712 -- and a pinion of Russia's defense industry. But in the 1990's, with falloffs in state orders and failed attempts to privatize, the industry, and thus the local economy, plummeted. 
Even the city's production of samovars, or Russian tea urns, suffered badly -- and most of those made now are for export, too expensive for local residents. Official unemployment in this city of 575,000 is put at 9,000, but it is much higher in the surrounding region, where huge collective farms have struggled to modernize.
Things have improved since President Putin took office almost two years ago. In an effort to consolidate the defense industry, he announced this month that Tula would become a center for manufacturing small missiles, which means guaranteed state orders. And then there are the joint ventures that have come in the last few years -- Procter & Gamble, which manufactures soaps and detergents, and Knopf, a German company producing construction materials. They pay well by Tula standards -- $300 to $400 a month.
"These two enterprises play the role of the defense industry in old times," said Aleksandr G. Yermakov, the editor of Molody Kommunar, an independent local newspaper. "They are the engines of our economy."
But Stanislav P. Kupriyanov, the Communist Party's regional secretary and a local deputy in the State Duma, criticized the Procter & Gamble plant for streamlining production so much that workers had been laid off. America's attempt to dominate Russia economically, he said, had replaced the effort to dominate it militarily.
That sentiment has some currency in a place where the Communist mayor is expected to be re-elected with 80 percent of the vote, and the region's Communist governor is equally entrenched. ("Those democrats know nothing but demagoguery," Mr. Kupriyanov said in explaining the party's continued popularity. Besides, he said, they had ruined the economy.)
A few weeks ago, Mr. Yermakov said, during the World Economic Forum in Moscow, what appeared to be a small, staged protest in Tula against globalization by a group of disinterested young men suddenly swelled when old people joined it, drawn by anti-American slogans.
"What kind of anti-globalists are these that Tula has?" he wondered.
They represent this city's aging population, which sometimes still sees America as the enemy. One woman said sarcastically that America had already "helped" Russia -- by disarming and therefore weakening it.
Among the young, attitudes toward America are considerably more nuanced, shaped by the lack of Communist propaganda against the United States, personal contacts formed through exchanges or business deals, or by the Internet or television. They don't see America as the enemy, but they don't see it as Utopia, either. They bristle at the suggestion that they should ape the West, and say American imports corrode their culture.
"I think after perestroika, when we opened to Western culture, after such a long period of being closed, we absorbed too much of it," said a student at Tula State University, Ileana Glinsteva, 18.
Another student, Daniel Medvedev, 18, praised Russian support for the antiterror coalition, but said the United States still interfered too much with other countries' interests. He did not like how the United States took sides in the conflict over Kosovo, or how it had judged Russia for fighting a war in Chechnya.
America's official attitude toward the Chechen war has been considerably softer since Sept. 11, and that perceived hypocrisy grates on some here. "When we're fighting terrorists, we're doing something wrong,"Mr. Volkov said. "But now, well, fighting terrorists is right."
But a trio of policemen, celebrating National Policemen's Holiday with on-the-house shots of vodka in a Tula cafe, said they were delighted that America was joining Russia in a fight against terrorism. They had wept when the World Trade Center collapsed, they said, and now included its victims in their toasts.
"We are ready to fight terrorism with the people of the United States," said Sergei Tsyastus, 43. "Chechnya and their leaders for us is what bin Laden is for the United States." He even praised the multinational corporations in the region. "What our governor cannot do for people," he said, "these companies can do."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ALLIANCE; 
U.S. Says Aid To Pakistan Won't Include F-16 Fighters

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has rejected Pakistan's request to release a fleet of F-16 jet fighters that it bought in the 1980's, American officials said today, adding that the United States wanted to avoid destabilizing relations in South Asia.
 In an interview with The New York Times published on Saturday, the president of Pakistan, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, said transferring the fighters would be an important symbolic gesture of American gratitude for his nation's strong support in the war in Afghanistan. 
 Pakistan purchased 28 F-16's in the 1980's, but their delivery was blocked when Congress cut off all aid and military sales in 1990, citing Pakistan's secret development of nuclear weapons. 
President Bush announced on Saturday that the United States was providing an aid package worth more than $1 billion to Pakistan in exchange for its war support, but the F-16's were conspicuously absent from the deal.
Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell discussed the matter with General Musharraf in meetings in New York but decided against making the fighters a part of renewed ties with Pakistan.
"They would like to have the planes," Secretary Powell said in an interview today, "but at the moment we are restarting our military-to-military relationship in a more serious way, and the planes are not an issue that we expect to be discussing in the very near future."
The Clinton administration settled the longstanding dispute over the planes by sending Pakistan cash and commodities worth more than $500 million, officials said today.
Despite the settlement, General Musharraf said Pakistan still wanted the planes, advanced fighter-bombers, as a visible sign that the United States was restoring Pakistan to the status of a genuine ally.
"I did take up this case, frankly, not because that much of it was significant from defense point of view," General Musharraf said on Sunday. "It has its significance, certainly, but not as much as I should have highlighted it. It's more for public perceptions in Pakistan."
Having his public request turned down flat was an embarrassing setback that he said would be "received negatively" in Pakistan.
Administration officials did not rule out releasing the fighters in the future, holding back an important carrot in Washington's evolving relationship with the general.
"We're at the very beginnings of resuming military-to-military contacts with Pakistan," an administration official said, "and right now we're looking at more modest requests, like providing spare parts and assisting their border security with helicopters."
Indeed, much of the calculus appeared to hinge on the United States balancing its diplomatic and military relations with Pakistan and India, Pakistan's neighbor and longtime rival. Both countries are nuclear powers.
Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, the United States has tried to patch up its relations with General Musharraf, who took power in a coup two years ago. Pakistan, the most prominent Islamic ally in the war in Afghanistan, has allowed American search-and-rescue aircraft and Special Operations forces to operate from several of its bases.
At the same time, the United States has improved its relations with India, and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld praised the improved ties on a recent visit there.
Transferring the F-16's now could upset that delicate balance, especially because the fighters are a combat aircraft that is capable of dropping nuclear weapons. "Any transfer of advanced weapons would get everyone all riled up," a State Department official said.
Lee Feinstein, a State Department official in the Clinton administration who worked on South Asia policy, said: "The United States has a new role in South Asia, and that is as a kind of guarantor of stability for Pakistan. At the same time, it wants to deepen relationship with India. The trick will be whether officials in all three capitals can can accommodate this."
There are other constraints to releasing the fighters, officials said.
In September, Mr. Bush lifted economic sanctions against Pakistan and India that were imposed after both countries conducted nuclear tests in 1998. But Pakistan's Defense Ministry remains under American sanctions for buying M-11 missiles from China in the early 1990's.
Mr. Bush waived some of those missile-related sanctions in September to allow Pakistan's military to help in the war in Afghanistan, but the full restrictions do not expire until November of next year, a State Department official said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: SECRETARY OF STATE; 
Global Kaleidoscope: Powell Notes Shifts After Sept. 11

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

 BODY:
Within 48 hours of September's terrorist strikes, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell telephoned Gen. Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan and said, "General, you have got to make a choice."
 The choice was whether to cast Pakistan's lot with the United States in the war that was coming, or remain an isolated and economically beleaguered state, crushed by foreign debt and sliding toward the same Islamic extremism that had brought the Taliban to power in neighboring Afghanistan. 
 "He knew the call was coming and said 'I'll talk to you soon,' " Secretary Powell recounted in an interview with The New York Times yesterday. "He took 24 hours to consult with all his political leaders and his generals and he made that choice -- not just a choice with respect to the Taliban, but a strategic choice with respect to where Pakistan was going to be in the future." 
In the wake of the horror of the September assault on America, a number of nations are examining the strategic choices they face, Secretary Powell said.
In this sense, disaster has also brought opportunity on a wide range of diplomatic fronts.
The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, also "made a strategic decision when he came out solidly and squarely for the campaign against terrorism, and essentially said, 'We are going to be a part of this, we are going to be a leader in this, with the U.S.' Now that was an important strategic choice," Secretary Powell said.
He suggested that contacts with several other countries -- including Iran and Syria -- could emerge from their frozen state as a result of the strategic shifts since Sept. 11.
"It remains to be seen in some of these states where we have had strained relations for many years, such as Syria and Iran, how that will play out," Secretary Powell said. "There have been contacts that we have never had before with these kinds of countries, and let's explore those opportunities without putting Vaseline in our eyes." He added, "When we hear that Iranians are willing to provide search and air rescue for American pilots, this is pretty interesting." In addition, he noted, "When you hear that there are pro-American demonstrations in Iran in support of President Khatami, things are going on."
Things already are going on in South Asia. Secretary Powell made clear today that he saw a deepening, long-term American engagement in South Asia and a "robust" military relationship with both India and Pakistan aimed at minimizing the risk of nuclear confrontation over the disputed territory of Kashmir and at containing extremism.
The secretary of state said he also saw new opportunities to address the civil conflicts and health crises holding back Africa's development, an issue on which he is becoming something of a missionary in the administration. 
Perhaps most important, in the Middle East, Secretary Powell said he was hoping for a strategic shift in the positions of Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, two unlikely candidates for staging the strategic breakthrough for a peace that seemed possible not so many months ago, but that has been shattered since.
Secretary Powell suggested today that the "humiliation" caused by the unresolved Palestinian homeland issue was a spawning ground for terrorism, of which Israeli civilians were most often the victims.
He expressed the hope that the strategic impetus for another push for comprehensive peace in the Middle East might flow from the traumatic events that have conferred on Mr. Bush a more influential role as arbiter. Secretary Powell said he himself was determined to "keep a broader view out as to what opportunities have been presented to us."

HEADLINE: Putin, Starting U.S. Trip, Predicts Missile Accord 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived on his first official visit to the United States tonight hours after predicting that a deal was within reach that would allow President Bush to speed ahead with tests of an antiballistic missile system.
 That deal would be the centerpiece of a meeting that begins Tuesday morning here, and moves on Wednesday and Thursday to the Bush ranch in Crawford, Tex. 
 When Mr. Putin arrives at the White House on Tuesday morning, he and Mr. Bush are widely expected to exchange their bottom-line figures for the mutual reduction of their nuclear arsenals. Mr. Bush has said he has reached a decision -- the guesswork is a cut to between 1,750 and 2,300 -- but has declined to release it before he tells Mr. Putin. 
Tonight, meeting Russian reporters at the White House, Mr. Bush said that he would give Mr. Putin tomorrow a number "substantially lower than today's weaponry, and I presume he'll have a number he'll share with me. The point is, what we don't need is the endless hours of arms control discussions."
With a least five or six statements expected during the course of the summit meeting, any arms control deal is not expected to be the first, or indeed only, tangible result of Mr. Putin's visit.
On Tuesday, Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush will release some of the five or six joint statements and letters that administration officials said their staffs have drafted in recent days.
The statements cover everything from nuclear reductions to economic initiatives to a vague statement by Mr. Putin that the White House hopes will temper any crackdown on Russia's independent media, which Mr. Putin critics say he has attempted to intimidate through a series of legal and financial pressures. 
One omission from the statements appears to be Chechnya, where Russian soldiers have employed often brutal tactics in their fight against Muslim rebels cast by Mr. Putin as Islamic extremists akin to Osama bin Laden.
During the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush said he doubted he could reach any agreement with Russia while Moscow was involved in human rights violations in Chechnya.
Now, with Mr. Putin a needed and valuable ally in the fight against terrorism, Washington has muted its criticism of Russia's behavior.
Saved for the Crawford meeting, where Mr. Bush has planned a Texas barbecue and country music for the Russian president, is an accord reinterpreting the 1972 ABM treaty to allow just the kind of missile defense testing it was meant to ban.
Mr. Bush, speaking wtih the Russian reporters, called the "a vestige of the past," adding, "We're having a lot of discussions about how to move beyond it."
Mr. Bush, officials say, will not repeat his threat to withdraw from the treaty, though his aides say that option will be held open. In return, Mr. Putin has strongly hinted that he would allow testing of the antimissile system -- a project in which Russia would become a parts supplier and participant. If an accord is reached, Mr. Putin would be able to return to Moscow claiming he has staved off American efforts to kill the treaty outright and immediately.
But several administration officials insist that Mr. Putin has come to the conclusion that the treaty will die a slow death, or be replaced by other agreements in future meetings. "We think that Putin has come to accept the ABM's ultimate demise," one administration official said today. "The question now is funeral arrangements."
Both men have traveled a considerable distance. Mr. Bush said during and after the campaign that he was determined to kill the treaty, which he has often said is "antiquated" and "dangerous." Mr. Putin traveled the world in the spring whipping up opposition to the American missile defense project. Now, he has apparently decided that the wiser course for Russia is to participate in its creation.
A few months ago, Mr. Bush might not have had the political latitude to reach any accord that keeps the ABM treaty in place, even temporarily.
But Russia's decision to side with Washington in the counterterrorism campaign, and Mr. Putin's move toward the West in general and Mr. Bush in particular, have silenced many conservatives who long desired to kill the ABM treaty.
Over the weekend, American and Russian officials met in New York to hammer out the wording of the joint statements and letters, and that process was still under way tonight.
Officially, Mr. Bush's aides are still playing down expectations for the visit. Condoleezza Rice, his national security adviser, has called this meeting -- the fourth between the two leaders, but the first on American soil -- "another step in a process." It has been clear for months, however, that if a broad accord is to be reached to begin building what Ms. Rice calls "a new strategic relationship," it should happen in Crawford.
At a joint press conference on Tuesday at the White House, Mr. Bush is expected to announce that Russia will be permanently removed from the list of countries subject to cold war-era sanctions under the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which concerned freedom of emigration. Those sanctions have not been imposed in a decade, but Russia wanted the threat of reimposing the penalties eliminated.
The administration will also vow to press for Russia's relatively swift inclusion in the World Trade Organization -- a feat China completed last weekend after 14 years -- and begin discussions on using Russian equipment as a central part of the antimissile system.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Stocks Fall, Then Rise as Fears of Terrorism as Crash's Cause Abate

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled in the wake of the American Airlines crash near Kennedy International Airport yesterday but rebounded when it appeared that the crash might be an accident rather than a result of a new terrorist attack.
 Airline, travel, entertainment and insurance stocks, all of which were hit hard after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, dropped sharply as the news of the plane crash about 9:17 a.m. hit the stock market just before it opened. 
 "It was difficult news for the market, coming just two months and a day after Sept. 11," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Stocks began to rally, however, after a White House briefing at noon. In the briefing, the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, seemed to calm fears that the crash was another terrorist attack. "I want to be very cautious about any conclusions at this early time about what is the cause of this," Mr. Fleischer said. "We have not ruled anything in, not ruled anything out." 
But Mr. Fleischer did say that communications with the plane before the crash had been normal and that the airport shutdowns in the New York City area would be over soon. He also said that the government had not received any credible threats of terror attacks in connection with yesterday's plane crash.
While oil stocks were also pulling the market lower, technology stocks like Ciena, Microsoft and Intel rose and helped push the Nasdaq composite index back into positive territory early in the afternoon.
The Nasdaq composite index, which was down as much as 2.5 percent, ended the day up 11.65 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1,840.13. The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell almost 2.7 percent, finished the day down just 53.63 points, or 0.6 percent, at 9,554.37. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was down almost 22 points, or 2 percent, but ended the day off just 1.98 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,118.33. The Nasdaq and the S.& P. are still above where they were before Sept. 11. The Dow is now just below its close of 9,605.51 on Sept. 10.
The stock of the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, plunged as much as 13.7 percent but finished the day down $1.64, or 9 percent, at $16.49. It has already fallen 40 percent since Sept. 11. Delta Air Lines fell $2.72, or 10.5 percent, to $23.27. It had fallen as low as $22.20. The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, which manufactured the Airbus that crashed, dropped 9 percent, to 12.60 euros ($11.27) in Paris.
Other travel and entertainment related stocks also rallied later in the day. Walt Disney, which was down as much as 4 percent, finished the day down 24 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $18.71. Marriott International, the hotel company, fell 6.3 percent and then ended the day at $32.50, down $1.50, or 4.4 percent. American Express plunged 5.2 percent early but closed at $32.09, down 62 cents, or 1.9 percent. Boeing, the aircraft maker, dropped 4.9 percent, then bounced back to be down 18 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $33.06.
Some insurance stocks also rallied after the initial downdraft. American International Group was down 3.4 percent early but ended the day up 11 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $79.80.
Oil company stocks fell as oil prices declined. Exxon Mobil dropped 19 cents, to $40.06. ChevronTexaco was off 26 cents, to $89.23. The price of a barrel of crude oil for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was down 99 cents, to $21.23. Analysts said the airplane crash might mean another decline in air travel and, therefore, a decline in fuel consumption. In addition, Russia's proposed reduction in oil production was much less than expected.
The losses in the Dow and the S.& P. 500 were reduced by Microsoft, which was up 58 cents, to $65.79; Intel, which rose 50 cents, to $28.38; I.B.M., which gained 78 cents, to $114.86; and Hewlett-Packard, which jumped 31 cents, to $19.30.
Ciena rose $1.65, or 9.6 percent, to $18.83. Ciena, a manufacturer of fiber optic equipment, said that its profit in the fourth quarter would meet or beat company forecasts. Ciena also said it would cut 380 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force.
While the stock market was open yesterday, it was a government holiday and the bond market was closed. So trading volume was below average, which can exaggerate moves in the prices of stocks and main market indexes. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1 billion shares traded, below the 1.2 billion average for daily trading over the last year.
Mr. Galvin of Credit Suisse First Boston said that he worried that the market had rallied so far and so fast recently that it might falter if new economic data did not show a turnaround soon. "The market has made a substantial move in a short period of time, and some people have their finger on the profit-taking button," he said. So far, he added, "stocks are up in the hope of a recovery,"
Thomas C. van Leuven, an equity strategist at J. P. Morgan, said that corporate earnings "are expected to improve very soon, but we are not convinced that is going to happen." With a background of weak earnings and continued disappointments, he said, the "market will have trouble making headway."

HEADLINE: Jobs That Recession May Never Touch 

BYLINE:  By WELD ROYAL 

 BODY:
Two and a half years ago, as seniors at St. Peter's College in Jersey City were flocking to the glamorous dot-com world across the river in Manhattan, Krzysztof Augustynowicz turned passionate about accounting.
 It happened at the end of his sophomore year, when Mr. Augustynowicz was hired by a medium-size accounting firm as a summer intern and given the job of managing government audits. "If the numbers weren't working out right, I had to spend my time interviewing people to understand the books," he said. "It was kind of like being a detective." He was hooked. 
 Mr. Augustynowicz, 22, went on to earn a bachelor's degree in accounting from St. Peter's and will finish a master's in finance next May. Though accountants are often pegged as boring -- an attitude he says is wrong -- they do have one big advantage: they will probably never be out of work.
Despite the shrinking economy, the slump in consumer spending and almost daily headlines about layoffs, some professions appear to be recession-proof simply because there are not enough people practicing them to meet demand. Since Sept. 11, not surprisingly, other fields have joined the list. They include security, biotechnology and bioinformatics, the use of computers to organize huge amounts of biological data into useful information -- now emerging as a tool to help fight bioterrorism. 
But a large number of more typical occupations -- from high school teachers to health care workers to computer engineers -- are also likely to flourish, as far as labor market prognosticators can see.
A review of how three people -- Mr. Augustynowicz; William Picot, a medical equipment technician, and Tammi Byrd, a dental hygienist -- found their way to careers they consider immune to shifts in the economy holds one simple lesson for people looking for job security: All three took a hard look at the labor market and singled out a livelihood where people seemed to have more to do than they could handle.
Mr. Augustynowicz, who moved to New Jersey from Poland as a boy, was inspired by the success of a cousin who works as an accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
"He has a really nice apartment, and a nice car -- an Audi," Mr. Augustynowicz said of his cousin. "He travels whenever he wants and wherever."
Even before he got his summer job, he was leaning in that direction, taking accounting courses and being elected president of the St. Peter's Accounting Club. It will be months before he finishes school, but he has already received four job offers and accepted one from KPMG International, beginning next fall at about $50,000.
That does not surprise Peter Gotlieb, associate dean for Experiential Learning and Career Services at St. Peter's. "Demand for accounting graduates and interns is still outstripping supply," he said, with companies luring the best candidates with offers that start as high as $51,000. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects as much as a 20 percent increase in jobs for accountants and auditors, to around 1.3 million in 2008.
William Picot thinks he can make a lot more than $51,000 repairing medical equipment. Though he is only 23, he says he believes that he will be able to start his own business in a couple of years and bring in a six-figure income.
Mr. Picot tripped into his line of work during a visit to a friend's home during his junior year in high school. The friend's parents cared for ill foster children, and the apparatus that helped one of them breathe had broken down. Mr. Picot struck up a conversation with the technician who came to fix the life-support ventilator. As he watched him work and listened to him talk about how much he liked his job -- and how much money he made -- he thought maybe that was where his future lay.
"I always knew I wanted to do something technical, and knew that a four-year degree wasn't for me," he said.
So he investigated two-year programs in medical equipment service and enrolled in the Biomedical Equipment Technology Department at Texas State Technical College in Waco. Roger A. Bowles, a senior instructor at the department, said graduates usually get three or four job offers starting anywhere from $39,000 to $50,000. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not break out medical technicians in its projections, but Mr. Bowles says openings could increase to as many as 4,000 within seven years from an estimated 1,000 last year.
Mr. Picot finished his studies in 1999 and joined the Children's Medical Center of Dallas, where he specializes in the repair and maintenance of respiratory equipment. But when he is on call, usually for a week once a month, he repairs any kind of medical device that malfunctions.
"There's a big demand for small biomedical companies that take care of specialty doctors' clinics, even veterinarians," he said. "They all need working equipment and are willing to pay outrageous dollars for it."
Ms. Byrd, the dental hygienist, does not expect to make outrageous money, but she has already started her own business. She worked for two decades in dental offices in Columbia, S.C., before founding Health Promotion Specialists in nearby Irmo last December. For start-up money, she mortgaged her house and persuaded her parents to mortgage theirs.
Dental hygienists -- the people who clean teeth and take X-rays -- are in high demand anyway. The bureau projects at least a 36 percent increase in jobs in that occupation, to around 195,000 by 2008.
Nonetheless, Ms. Byrd developed what she hopes is a foolproof plan for success: she went to an area where the shortage was acute. In one county she serves, there is only one dentist for every 10,000 people, she said. Business boomed, and now her firm counts a staff of 21, among them 16 hygienists.
"We had planned on being in three to four counties in South Carolina during the school year that ended in June, but we ended up in 34," Ms. Byrd said.
Her income has not increased much from her days as a salaried employee, but that does not bother her. "I'm not looking to be a multimillionaire," she said. "But I am looking to pay off the mortgage on my house."

HEADLINE: Cablevision Says Its Loss Grew Wider In 3rd Quarter 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BETHPAGE, N.Y., Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The Cablevision Systems Corporation, the cable operator that owns Madison Square Garden and the New York Knicks, posted a wider third-quarter loss today after writing off some player contracts.
 The loss widened to $77.1 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with $40.1 million, or 23 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales slipped 3.8 percent, to $1 billion from $1.04 billion after the company sold some cable systems. 
 Sales at Madison Square Garden fell 11 percent because of fewer concerts and shows. The company said last month that the Sept. 11 attacks would reduce attendance at events. Cablevision would not disclose which players' contracts hurt results. An injury forced the Knicks forward Larry Johnson to retire last month, ending a 10-year career.
"Given the weak economy and people being afraid of congregating in places with a lot of people, Madison Square Garden is a problem," said Uri Landesman, chief investment officer of AFA Management Partners. 
Shares of Cablevision declined $1, to $35.42. Cablevision, which also controls the New York Rangers, owns cable systems serving three million homes in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 
Third-quarter depreciation and amortization costs rose 14 percent, to $271.2 million, as Cablevision upgraded its cable systems for digital television, which offers hundreds of channels and fast Internet service. 
Cablevision expects to have more than 490,000 subscribers for fast Internet service by the end of the year, more than the 475,000 previously forecast. Cablevision had 423,100 such customers as of Sept. 30.
Sales at the company's cable systems and assets that are not included in the Rainbow Media tracking stock, including the Wiz chain of consumer electronics stores, fell 6 percent, to $864.4 million.
Sales from the Rainbow Media business, which includes cable TV networks like Bravo and American Movie Classics, jumped 19 percent, to $143.5 million.

HEADLINE: Earnings Rise At Wal-Mart, Home Depot And Penney 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc. posted gains in third-quarter profits yesterday, while the J. C. Penney Company rebounded from a loss.
 Net income rose 8.2 percent at Wal-Mart and 20 percent at Home Depot, the largest home-improvement chain. J. C. Penney reported a $31 million profit, in contrast to a $30 million loss in the quarter a year earlier. 
 Each retailer took a different approach to keep earnings afloat in the slowing economy. Wal-Mart added stores and cut prices to take customers from rivals. Home Depot scaled back inventory and expansion plans to lower expenses, while J. C. Penney reworked its merchandise. 
At Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., net income rose to $1.48 billion, or 33 cents a share, compared with $1.37 billion, or 31 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The results matched analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
An expanded selection of groceries and steeper-than-usual discounts helped Wal-Mart increase sales 15 percent, to $52.7 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 6.7 percent, outpacing the industry's composite gain each month of the quarter.
The low margins on groceries and the discounts on other goods dragged the gross margin lower, though, as did the increased costs of utilities, insurance, store maintenance and medical benefits. Gross margin, the percentage of sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold, fell to 21.52 percent from 21.85 percent in the quarter a year earlier.
Shares of Wal-Mart fell 58 cents, to $55.
Home Depot, based in Atlanta, said net income rose to $778 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with $650 million, or 28 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales in the quarter rose 15 percent, to $13.3 billion from $11.5 billion.
The company's chief executive, Bob Nardelli, has demanded lower prices from suppliers in his cost-cutting efforts and relied on high-margin services like tool rentals to increase profits.
Sales at stores open at least a year were unchanged, below analysts' forecast for a 1 percent gain.
Home Depot's results met analysts' expectations.
Shares of Home Depot rose $2.88, to $44.
J. C. Penney, based in Plano, Tex., reported net income of 9 cents a share, matching forecasts. The loss in the quarter a year earlier was 30 cents a share. Sales rose 2.5 percent, to $7.73 billion.
Allen Questrom, the chairman and chief executive, has added Disney children's clothing and Avon makeup to J. C. Penney stores to revive sales, while the company's Eckerd drugstores filled more prescriptions.
Shares of J. C. Penney rose $1.50, to $25.25.

Assessing Money's Role In Making Schools Better

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MANY school reforms today are intended to narrow the achievement gap between middle-class and poor children. Holding all pupils to the same high academic standard is one approach. Increasing school funds is another.
 Courts in several states have ordered equal spending on schools in communities that differ in wealth. In New York earlier this year, a judge found the state system unconstitutional because it results in less money for city schools compared with suburban ones. 
 But even if such judicial decisions were fully enforced, equality would remain elusive.
Some advocates of higher standards say that more spending would not raise academic performance. The Bush administration opposes big budget increases in the Senate version of an education bill currently being debated, arguing that more money for schools has not, in the past, produced better results.
But the notion that extra money doesn't matter would be hard to sell to suburban parents who exert great efforts raising money to supplement what taxes provide to schools.
If graduates must vie for society's rewards, privileged parents understandably want to position their own children for the competition. For this, maintaining school differentials is as important as high standards. So if city schools improve, suburban parents want their children's education to improve even more.
This is one reason for the extraordinary growth of private gifts to public schools in wealthier areas. Nationwide, parent contributions lead to smaller classes, enriched curriculum (like theatrical performances), more computers, added college counseling and better-stocked libraries.
These extras put policy makers in a quandary. Private gifts counteract judicial efforts to equalize resources across all social classes. But in a free society, parents should have the right to provide added benefits for their own children. Occasional efforts by school officials to ban private fund-raising have failed, either because parents figure out how to evade the bans or take steps to transfer children to more exclusive private schools.
The dilemma is stark in large, diverse districts where resources of schools attended by the rich should, in principle, equal those of other schools. The Washington suburb of Montgomery County, Md., for example, prohibits affluent schools from hiring additional regular teachers with private money. But wealthier parents have circumvented this effort to equalize spending by financing building improvements, extra library books and even faculty salary increases, euphemistically called appreciation payments.
New York City also prohibits private payments for additional regular classroom teachers, but parents in more affluent neighborhoods achieve a similar result by financing art and music teachers, called "consultants." Los Angeles gave up trying to enforce its policy that "no donation shall provide a substantial advantage in educational benefits if such benefits cannot be balanced in all schools."
In wealthy suburbs like Brookline, Mass.; Shaker Heights, Ohio; and Beverly Hills, Calif., parent-sponsored foundations with multimillion-dollar endowments provide extra income for public schools that neighboring cities can't emulate.
Many urban districts try to compete by enticing corporate donors to provide extra dollars for schools with disadvantaged students. But while this philanthropy helps, it doesn't bring spending close to amounts in the more affluent suburbs.
Financing extra art, music or computers partly reflects laudable parental ambition for enriched children's experiences. But middle-class families also buy other private advantages that accomplish nothing for society as a whole, like SAT coaching that typically costs $150 a week. Its only purpose is to give a child an edge over others who may be just as qualified for college but can't afford cram sessions.
California legislators, disturbed by how suburban SAT tutoring nullified the competitive value of improved scores among urban students, hoped to level the field by financing SAT coaching in low-income schools. State dollars now pay for test preparation classes of 15 to 20, certainly a help, but nothing like the one-on-one tutoring the rich can buy.
Better urban education is an end in itself, even if it can't keep up with schools in the suburbs. But we've come to expect initiatives like more accountablity and equalized school spending to shoulder almost the entire burden of making competition between graduates fully fair.
Schools alone can't accomplish such leavening. Greater social equality will always have to rely on economic and social tools (progressive tax policies or even affirmative action in employment, for example) to equalize the results of inevitably unequal educations.

HEADLINE: Loan Activity at Fannie Mae Sets Record 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Fannie Mae, the No. 1 buyer of home loans, said today that it had made commitments to buy a record $33.6 billion in mortgage loans in October, as home loan refinancing surged to a record.
 The amount of loans that the company agreed to buy was up from $16.4 billion in September, when loan production was down because of the terrorist attacks, and exceeds the previous high of $30.2 billion in October 1998. 
 Fannie Mae is benefiting from a housing boom spurred by 10 interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which lowered the 30-year mortgage rate to a record low of 6.45 percent last week. The Mortgage Bankers Association of America expects mortgage lending to top $1.8 trillion this year, surpassing 1998's record of $1.5 trillion.

HEADLINE: Gold Coin Sales Rose Sharply After Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Sales of gold as an investment soared worldwide after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, but the rise in the third quarter was offset by weakness in the jewelry market, the World Gold Council said yesterday. 
 The trade group said that in the United States, sales of new gold coins, often seen as a safe-harbor investment in times of uncertainty, rose more than 400 percent to 3.5 metric tons in the July-September period from a year earlier. 
A metric ton is equal to about 2,205 pounds. 
 That offset a drop in the demand for gold for jewelry, resulting in total third-quarter demand in the United States of 104.4 tons, a 1 percent increase from a year earlier. For the first nine months of the year, demand for gold in the United States was 278.3 tons, a 3 percent rise from a year earlier. 
Worldwide, a sharp decline in jewelry demand because of slowing economies outweighed the increase in gold for investment, the World Gold Council said. 
Global demand was 755 tons in the third quarter, down 7 percent from a year earlier, the council said. The figure was pulled down by weak demand for gold for jewelry. Investment demand was up 17 percent at 106 tons. For the first nine months of the year, demand was 2,356 tons, down 2 percent. 
"Both the global slowdown and the aftermath of Sept. 11 affected demand in most countries, but the manner and extent of the effects varied widely," the council said.

HEADLINE: $25.8 Million Loss Logged at OfficeMax 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
OfficeMax Inc., the office products discount retailer, reported a loss of $25.8 million in the third quarter today and blamed the weak economy and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks for a drop in sales.
 The loss was wider than expected. 
The company reported a net loss of 23 cents a share, compared with a loss of 20 cents a share a year ago. Excluding a reserve for legal matters, the loss was 17 cents a share. Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had predicted a loss of 11 cents a share. 
 OfficeMax, which is based in Cleveland, had expected a loss in the third quarter because of infrastructure improvement costs, but it said the loss was more severe because of the attacks. 
The company, comparing sales trends before and after Sept. 11, estimated that the attacks resulted in a sales decline of $30 million, a spokesman said. OfficeMax's third-quarter sales dropped to $1.18 billion, an 8.5 percent decrease. 
OfficeMax operates 993 superstores in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands and joint-venture stores in Mexico and Brazil.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rally on Hopes for Quick End to the Afghan War

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rallied yesterday, with the broad market hitting levels unseen since late August, on expectations of a speedy conclusion to the war in Afghanistan.
 Investors scooped up stocks across the board as it became clear that the deadly plane crash in New York on Monday was probably an accident, not a terrorist attack. Helping fuel bullish sentiment were upbeat financial results from retailing giants like Home Depot and a positive forecast from a top semiconductor company, Texas Instruments. 
 "Today the political concerns have abated a little bit," said Rick Meckler, president of the investment firm LibertyView, which oversees $1 billion. "It has allowed those people who would prefer to focus on the economic stimulus in the market to go out and buy." 
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average jumped 196.58 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 9,750.95 -- its biggest percentage gain since Nov. 1. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 20.76 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,139.09. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index climbed 51.98 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,892.11.
It was the highest close for the Nasdaq and the S.& P. since late August and the strongest finish for the Dow since Sept. 6. The Taliban's hard-line Islamic rule of Afghanistan appeared to be in tatters after the opposition Northern Alliance took control of the capital, Kabul, and other critical areas. 
Charlie Crane, a strategist at Victory SBSF Capital Management, which oversees $4 billion, said investors were acting as if the war was "not going to be a protracted drag on economic activity.
"It allows investors to focus on what positives may unfold as a result of monetary and fiscal stimuli that have been applied with a very heavy hand over the last several months," he added.
Airline and hotel stocks rebounded from steep losses after the Monday plane crash in New York. United States officials said early information suggested that the crash of the American Airlines passenger jet was an accident. Shares of AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose 52 cents, or 3 percent, to $17.01.
The S.& P.'s airline index rebounded 4.68 percent as fears faded that Monday's crash would take another bite out of the travel industry. Delta Air Lines rose $1.41, or more than 6 percent, to $24.68. 
Semiconductor makers like Intel gained on hopes the chip industry had scraped bottom. Texas Instruments rose $1.92, to $33.82, after saying the third quarter might have been the low point for semiconductor orders. Intel added $1.67, to $30.05. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index rose 4.1 percent, reflecting gains by other companies in the sector like Applied Materials, up $1.84, to $40.80.

Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as the advance of United States-backed forces into the Afghan capital prompted investors to buy stocks, reducing demand for the safety of government debt.
"It's a little bit of stocks, a little bit of Kabul" that is pushing Treasuries lower, said Barry Evans, who oversees $10 billion at John Hancock Funds in Boston. "There's no new negative news; it's slightly more positive."
The 10-year Treasury note fell 16/32, to a price of 104 29/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.38 percent from 4.31 percent on Monday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 20/32, to 107 2/32. The bond's yield rose to 4.92 percent from 4.88 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: Citing Sept. 11, 2 Sides Avert Janitors' Strike 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
New York's largest janitors' union signed a tentative three-year agreement with the real estate industry yesterday, seven weeks before the contract deadline. Both sides said the surprise move was intended to minimize uncertainty during an anxious time for the city's businesses.
 The development is a far cry from the usual practice, when every third Thanksgiving the managers of Manhattan's office towers warn thousands of tenants of a possible janitors' strike that could force them to clean their own offices and haul their garbage out themselves. 
 The agreement saves tenants -- and the new mayor -- from having to worry about a replay of early 1996, when 30,000 janitors walked out for a month, as garbage piled up inside office towers and unshoveled snow piled up outside. 
"This is anti-stress medication," said Paul Salvatore, a lawyer for the building owners and managers.
The agreement applies to almost all of Manhattan's important commercial buildings, including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Center.
Negotiators for the two sides said they did not want the talks to drag on until Jan. 1, when the current contract expires, because that would have forced building managers to concentrate on dealing with a strike, instead of their biggest current concern -- keeping security tight after the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.
In an unusual twist, the two sides talked far less about the details of the new accord than about the importance of reaching an agreement early to help calm the city's frayed nerves. The negotiators voiced fears that if a contract dispute erupted into a strike, it could increase the number tenants thinking of leaving Manhattan after the terrorist attack.
As part of the tentative agreement, which must still be voted on by the rank and file, nearly 30,000 janitors, handymen and elevator operators will receive a 9.5 percent wage increase over three years. Wages for janitors, already the highest in the nation, will rise to $763.92 a week at the end of the contract, which calls for annual raises of $21, $22 and $23 per week in consecutive years.
In addition, the real estate industry agreed to increase its health insurance contribution by more than $1,000 per worker per year by the end of the agreement. The industry, which currently pays $105.51 per worker year for insurance, will increase its weekly payment to $129.51 per worker, meaning an annual contribution per worker of $6,735.
James F. Berg, president of the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, an association of building owners and managers, estimated that when improvements in fringe benefits were included, the contract translated into a 3.8 percent annual increase in compensation.
Some labor experts said that management gave the workers slightly more than might have been expected because it was so intent on insuring labor peace in a time of stress and uncertainty, when Manhattan's real estate vacancy rate is rising and some businesses are threatening to leave. But because of such unusual factors, the contract might not have much influence on other labor contracts negotiated in New York.
"This is a good example of labor-management cooperation," said Esta R. Bigler, director of the New York City campus of the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations.
"Given the economic situation we're facing in the city, a contract of more than 3 percent a year for three years looks like an excellent contract for the union."
After Sept. 11, the union, Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union, and the real estate industry agreed to seek to speed up negotiations to prevent their usual December tensions.
Michael Fishman, president of the Local 32B-32J, said, "With the instability in the market and people packing up for the suburbs, stability is very important, and this contract helps achieve stability."
The two sides signed the agreement yesterday after the union's 500-person contract advisory team overwhelmingly approved the deal. The union will mail ballots to all its employees working in New York City commercial buildings later this month.
To keep the negotiations from deadlocking, the two sides took off the table many issues that they had usually wrestled over right up until deadline. For instance, management was so eager for a settlement that it decided not to insist on increasing the amount of square footage each janitor was expected to clean -- an issue that management had traditionally dug in on.
The agreement also includes increases in pension benefits and in the employers' contribution to workers' 401(k)'s.
In an unusual provision, the real estate industry agreed to contribute $2 million to a training fund that would be used for management and workers to develop better security procedures for matters like handling mail and responding to threats.
Kenneth Patton, a member of management's negotiating committee, said: "Usually negotiations are us against them. But it's different now. There's a recognition that the well-being of the tenants and of the city is the overarching concern."
Local 32B-32J and the industry have developed a stronger relationship in recent years. Most recently, the union and management agreed to far-reaching steps to help more than a thousand janitors, security guards and others who lost their jobs when the World Trade Center was destroyed.
Management pledged to work with the union to provide the workers with health insurance and supplemental unemployment insurance equal to 80 percent of their gross pay for six months.
Several dozen cleaning contractors also agreed to give preference to laid-off janitors in future hiring.

HEADLINE: Shift From Food Stamps To Private Aid Widens 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Five years after the government scaled back its responsibility for the poor, more people get food from private charities over the course of the year than participate in the federal government's food stamp program, according to a yearlong survey to be released on Wednesday.
 Emergency feeding sites around the country serve more than 7 million people in a given week, the survey found, and more than 23 million people at some point in the course of a year obtain food from food pantries, soup kitchens and shelters, most of them run by religious charities. Four years ago, a similar survey found 21.4 million Americans using private food charity. 
 During the same time, 17.7 million people used federal food stamps, a drop from the 21.9 million who received food stamps in 1997, according to the Agriculture Department. 
The survey was conducted on behalf of America's Second Harvest, a national network of nonprofit food banks that provides 80 percent of the food distributed by private charities.
While the Agriculture Department does not keep records on a weekly basis, there is no dispute that fewer people are using food stamps and more people are turning to private food aid. But the food stamp program still provides far more food in a given year than the private food emergency network.
"People are now turning to us as an alternative, a replacement when we had considered ourselves a back-up or emergency system," said Douglas O'Brien, director of public policy and research at Second Harvest.
In New York City, the number of people who in the course of a year obtained at least some emergency food relief tripled in the last four years, to 1.5 million this year from 425,000 in 1997, surveys showed. Those figures mean one out of five New Yorkers was visiting food pantries or soup kitchens this year.
"These figures really underscore the enormity of the hunger crisis that existed well before Sept. 11," said Lucy Cabrera, president of Food for Survival Inc., a New York food bank.
Since then, Dr. Cabrera said her group had seen a decrease in individual contributions, while demand had grown to 6.4 million pounds of food in October from 4 million pounds a month. 
The report presents this portrait of hunger in the nation: Instead of homeless people dying of starvation on the streets, hungry Americans are working families, skimping on food to meet their monthly bills. They are children whose parents eat the family leftovers. They are the elderly poor, rural and suburban Americans, and the permanently unemployed who scrape together government payments like Social Security and food stamps.
And it includes people who have been dropped from federal social services since the 1996 welfare overhaul and are finding their sole support in the lines at food pantries and hot meals served in churches.
By coincidence, the survey is being released as Congress debates the $171 billion farm bill, which includes reauthorization of the food stamp program.
The food stamp program was cut by $26 billion over six years in the last farm bill as part of the welfare overhaul. Congress also instituted more stringent rules to reduce fraud in the program. That led many states to increase the paperwork required to receive food stamps, which helped discourage as many as 12 million eligible people from applying for food stamps. 
Even before this survey, lawmakers said the food stamp program needed to be strengthened to help the poor deal with the recent economic downturn.
The question is whether to increase financing by $3.6 billion over 10 years, as recommended by the House, or by $6.2 billion or $10 billion, proposals that are under consideration in the Senate this week. Congress is also trying to simplify the rules for receiving food stamps so more people will take advantage of the program.
The survey by Mathematica Policy Research of more than 32,700 people receiving private food aid and 24,000 local agencies providing it nationwide painted this picture of the people receiving private food aid:
*Women account for nearly two-thirds of the adults receiving emergency food aid. 
*Nearly half of the households receiving aid included children. 
*People receiving food stamps made up nearly one-third of those seeking emergency food aid. They said their food stamps covered only half their monthly need, on average.
*Half the people receiving food aid said they were regularly forced to choose between buying food or paying for utilities or heat.
*Working families made up 40 percent of people receiving food aid.
Further propelling the shift toward private relief aid was the Bush administration's initiative to encourage religious charities to provide more social services.
Not surprisingly, religious groups, which run most of the food pantries and kitchens, strongly support increasing money for food stamps. 
"We think there is no substitute for a strong food stamp program," said the Rev. David Beckman, president of Bread for the World, a group made up of Protestant and Roman Catholic churches. "It is much better for kids to have their Mom and Dad serve them food around the table rather than drag them into a food kitchen. And I'm not sure we churches, synagogues and mosques can keep up with the demand."
Doug Besharov, an expert on welfare at the American Enterprise Institute, said private food programs were unfairly burdened because they were often the only help available for the poor. He argued that in some instances, particularly the elderly, they might need money to pay utility bills, rather than more food stamps.
"I'm uncomfortable about anyone being hungry, but the question now is how do we fix it without making it worse," he said. "Sometimes the food program is the wrong program to look for the fix."

HEADLINE: THE CRASH OF FLIGHT 587: THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC; 
Strong New York Ties Bind Families in Grief

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: BANI, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The 15 years that Diego Lugo owned several bodegas in Brooklyn left him scarred with bullet holes in his arm, his leg and his head from three violent robberies. It was the price he paid for a better life, working 12-hour days alongside his wife, Ramona Pimentel, as they saved money to return in 1997 to this town, which they had fled after Hurricane David devastated the island and its economy.
 Today, however, the spacious two-story home that they had built selling beer, soda and cigarettes is desolate. The candles they had planned to light Monday night to celebrate their common birthday instead were replaced by a solitary votive light. Mr. Lugo sat sobbing in a wheelchair, trembling at the fact that Ramona, his wife of 36 years, died on American Airlines flight 587, returning home after a brief, but regular, visit with her stateside relatives. 
 "Fifteen years working in New York for nothing," Mr. Lugo cried, railing at God and his misfortune. "I lost my partner, that is all I accomplished. The greatest thing I had in my life was her. All I want is for God to take me and end this life."
The sorrow inside his house was shared among many residents of this town of about 57,000, 41 miles west of Santo Domingo, where officials estimated at least 15 of their neighbors perished in the crash. The toll reflected both the financial lure of New York City for these scrappy people as well their enduring love for their homeland. 
Those twin tugs were evident in the pastel-colored cinder-block homes built with dollars from New York, or stores that sold Dominican flag bumper stickers alongside books with titles like "Learn English to Earn Money." In an age of cheap flights and easy phone calls, New York was as familiar to them as any Dominican village.
On a street corner near the town plaza, dozens of people clustered around a passenger list mounted on a propped-up sandwich board, nervously pointing to names and gasping or refusing to believe that a friend had died. Many long-lost sons and daughters in self-imposed exile were returning here to celebrate the nine days of feasts, music and processions in honor of the town's patron, La Virgen de Regla. Instead, there will be nine days of rosaries.
"This city has a deep feeling for New York, since there is not a single family here without a relative there," said Radames Altagracia, an adviser to the mayor. "New York is a place of hope. There you can resolve all your economic problems. But you always return here, to your home."
Mr. Lugo was used to coming home in his 28 years as a sailor, first with the Dominican Navy and later with the Dominican Merchant Marine. Ramona, was always there to greet him at dockside, eagerly scampering on board to embrace him. But in the early 1980's he decided on one last adventure, to New York, where many of his countrymen had ventured into the bodega business that had helped a previous generation of Puerto Rican migrants achieve their modest dream -- an education for their children and a house back home as their reward.
He borrowed from a cooperative, sometimes selling his store when sales soured or rents increased. In 1987, Ramona joined him in Brooklyn, where they finally settled by the mid-1990's in an apartment above their bodega on Tompkins Avenue and Quincy Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Though they were robbed at gunpoint several times, Mr. Lugo and his wife clung to their dream of saving enough money to return to Bani triumphant, not defeated. But in 1997, robbers shot Mr. Lugo and beat his wife. He spent 15 days in Kings County Hospital, his second time there, just as previous robberies had landed him at Woodhull Hospital and in other emergency rooms.
"She begged me to leave the business and never return to New York," Mr. Lugo said. "So I took a loss and abandoned it."
Their home is roomy and neat, with a huge kitchen and bright bedrooms, built over the years as their savings allowed. She returned to New York every year, to visit family and renew her American residency papers, always coming to back to Bani with presents for her grandchildren.
Today, the children are quiet and the adults are dazed.
"All those years of sacrifice, all those bodegas, and this house here is from the little success they enjoyed," said her sister, Josefina Pimentel. 
A few blocks away, Jose Hilton Sanchez and his brother Elvis had grown up with the idea of moving to New York, too. They had been there more than 10 years already, working at a bodega their uncle owned on 134th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Jose had already grown tired of the city and was looking to come back. Elvis was a little more adventurous, and wanted to stay a while longer, though both were headed to Bani for the religious festival and an early Christmas holiday.
"They went to New York aspiring to get something and return to their country," said their mother, Altagracia Sanchez. "I cannot say they accomplished a lot, because the economy is bad everywhere you go. But Jose was coming back, hoping to buy a house."
Silence has descended upon the town plaza, where a stage sits empty as the country mourns until Friday. Vendors who had stocked up on food, drinks and toys, wait for customers to return. Some murmured that the crash was divine retribution for some neighbors who went to New York to sell drugs or make trouble. Others asked if this might not humble those who returned here to lord over their less fortunate neighbors. Some of them said they would never want to go to New York now, not after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 or Monday's plane crash, which they refuse to believe was an accident.
But Jose Ramirez sat by his stall, which overflowed with unsold toy trucks and dolls, thinking of Washington Heights, a place as storied to him as the Lower East Side was to European Jews a century ago.
"We Dominicans will never stop going to New York," he declared. "Here, we find nothing. There you struggle, but your get money. Everything and everybody is over there. If someone asked me, I jump up and leave right now."

HEADLINE: THE CRASH OF FLIGHT 587: WASHINGTON HEIGHTS; 
A Plane Crash Deeply Wounds a City's Dominican Heart

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
Washington Heights had a facade of normalcy about it yesterday. Traffic was bumper-to-bumper on Broadway. Schools and bodegas were open. Beauty salons and lunch counters were full.
 But behind the bustle, the city's Dominican heartland was in deep mourning. 
 Some signs were quiet. There was the post office at West 180th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, where the flag flew at half-staff. And the hair salon on Broadway and W. 175th Street, with a mirror with two black ribbon wreaths taped to it. 
Other signs were less subdued. At Alianza Dominicana, the social service agency, Rosa Mota gave her sobbing cousin, Luna Estrella Soto, a tight hug to ease the pain of the loss of her brother, Daniel Estrella Soto. At the makeshift memorials that sprung up on sidewalks, passers-by gathered, some gasping as they recognized their neighbor's face in a photograph.
At one memorial, at the corner of West 163rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue, a large picture of "La Virgen de Altagracia," the Dominican Republic's patron saint, watched over dozens of votive candles that had been dropped off by neighbors like Yolanda Frias, 74, who had not lost family or friends on American Airlines Flight 587 but nevertheless broke into tears at the news of its crash.
"We may not be friends but in this neighborhood we know each other by sight," she said. "These were human beings, all lost in a matter of three minutes. It's so unbelievable."
But even in this upper Manhattan neighborhood, some people wondered whether the catastrophic events of Sept. 11 had somehow dulled the grieving over Flight 587. They said residents already seemed sadder and more reflective since the terrorist attacks, a mood that perhaps made this latest horrifying episode less convulsive than it would have been otherwise.
"People are in another world," said Alexandra Reyes, whose family owns "Botanica Reyes," a shop that sells herbal remedies and religious paraphernalia and has done a brisk business on candles since the World Trade Center attacks. "They are preoccupied, pensive. It's like, 'We're all going to go.' People are praying more than ever."
While Washington Heights suffered losses from the World Trade Center attack like the rest of New York, this time it took a more direct hit, feeling the impact of the crash almost as instantaneously as Belle Harbor, the Queens neighborhood where the Santo Domingo-bound plane fell. The majority of the 260 people on board were of Dominican descent, many of them with addresses in this working-class section, which has the highest concentration of Dominicans in the city.
This time, amid the American flags that hang from windows and lampposts, the candles in vigils and sidewalk memorials burn for compatriots who were livery-cab drivers and small-shop owners, laborers and professionals, all making a living in New York with one foot planted firmly in the homeland.
A candlelight vigil at J. Hood Wright Park last night drew about 200 people, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He told the gathering he would work with the Rockaway Peninsula and Washington Heights communities to organize a memorial service next week.
"I think it would be a beautiful thing for this city if we could bring both communities together so that we could all pray together and show how united we are," he said to loud applause.
The disaster took a heavy toll in the public schools of the area, where most of the 29,000 students in District 6 are Dominican. The ripple effect was also felt at the F&P Food Market on West 184th Street, where owner Ruth Paez mourned the death of a customer, Felix Gervacio, 36, who bought calling cards to telephone his family in the Caribbean and had wanted to marry a friend of hers.
"How's that girl?" he would ask Ms. Paez, even after he was turned down.
At the Church of the Incarnation Roman Catholic Church on St. Nicholas Avenue, a memorial Mass for the community was planned for Nov. 20. 
More than a third of Dominican households in the city are poor and more than three-fourths are headed by people born in the Dominican Republic, the latest census data shows. But a community whose immigration started in earnest in the 1960's also has established business and social institutions that now have been called on to help residents cope with the loss of many family breadwinners.
An estimated 25 percent of the about 500,000 Dominicans in the city live in the area encompassing Washington Heights and neighboring Inwood, according to the Census Bureau.
"Unemployment is so large here," said the Rev. Ricardo Fajardo of St. Catherine's of Genova Roman Catholic Church on West 143rd Street, where a Sunday Mass is planned for the victims.
"The families will need help with rent and food to survive." said Father Fajardo.
Alianza Dominicana, which is playing a key role in comforting victims and directing them to government assistance and had helped more than 60 families by noon yesterday, and the Rev. Ruben Diaz, head of a Bronx ministry, announced the formation of a fund, "Aid to the Victims of Flight 587" to provide families with long-term help.
And officials with the Dominican Republic Consul General office in Times Square said the Dominican Republic had established a commission on Monday to assist families and investigate the crash. The consulate was negotiating with American Airlines to transport bodies to the Dominican Republic while Senator Charles E. Schumer said he had received a commitment from the Justice Department to expedite visas for family members who want to travel to New York to attend funerals.
David Rivas of Rivas Travel, a travel agency in the area that sold 20 tickets for the ill-fated flight and does $4 million in annual ticket sales to the Dominican Republic, said that business was normal and agents had registered few cancellations for future American Airlines flights. He said the airline had changed the flight number from 587 to 619.
Some said life was hardly normal anymore.
"Friends of friends died in the crash," said Humberto Rivas, an empanada vendor.
"I'm telling you, this community is in pain," he said. "We just don't understand it."

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Tougher Lending Practices by Banks 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Banks imposed tougher standards on business and consumer loans over the last three months because of the slowing economy, a Federal Reserve survey of bank loan officers showed today. Loan demand also fell.
 The survey found that 28 of the 57 banks surveyed had "tightened somewhat" the availability of loans to large and midsize companies with sales of at least $50 million a year. One had tightened its standards "considerably," and 28 had not changed their policies, the Fed said. 
 The Fed reported that 14 of 22 foreign-based banks operating in the United States "tightened somewhat" over the last three months, while one had "tightened considerably." Six foreign banks had not changed their policies, and one had relaxed the availability of credit somewhat.
"All survey respondents," the Fed said, "pointed to a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook as at least a somewhat important reason for changing their commercial lending policies."
John Moore, an analyst at Wachovia Securities, said banks had slowed lending to some industries, like airlines and textiles, more than to others. "The quality of the borrower is not what it was a year ago," Mr. Moore said, citing the weak economy as the reason banks are more reluctant to lend. 
One in five banks in the new survey reported that they had tightened standards for credit card and other consumer loans over the three months, the Fed said. But standards for approving residential mortgages did not change in the period. The Fed said that 25 percent of banks surveyed reported weaker demand for consumer loans.
The Fed reported that the percentage of domestic banks that reported tighter lending standards for business loans had risen to 51 percent in October, from 40 percent in August. The percentage of United States branches of foreign banks that tightened standards rose to 64 percent in October from 50 percent in August.
Among its findings, the Fed reported that more than 70 percent of domestic banks reported weaker demand for commercial loans from large and midsize companies, up from 50 percent in August.
Banks cited less demand for capital to finance capital expenditures and a decline in mergers and acquisitions and inventory as a reason for the drop in demand, the Fed said.

HEADLINE: Trade Officials, Feeling Pressure to Avert a Damaging Setback, Extend Talks in Qatar 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: DOHA, Qatar, Wednesday, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Representatives of 142 nations wrangled into the early morning today, past their deadline to reach agreement on a comprehensive plan to liberalize world trade.
 The negotiations are widely seen as crucial to stimulating the global economy and restoring confidence in the trading system, which suffered a severe blow two years ago when similar talks collapsed in Seattle. 
 Ministers here said their willingness to continue talks suggested an agreement remained within reach. But the possibility of failure continued to hover over the discussions, which bogged down over food-export subsidies and environmental and investment rules. 
The participants, exhausted by five days of nearly nonstop haggling, still tried to forge compromises on core trade issues that have been on the agenda for years. One incentive to continue discussions is a common feeling that a setback could damage prospects for economic recovery and potentially reduce the rate of growth in trade that powered the world economy in the 1990's.
There is also concern about the viability of the World Trade Organization itself, the umbrella trade body that depends on consensus agreements by its members to work toward freer trade.
"If we fail, this is the end of the W.T.O.," the agriculture minister of Brazil, Marcus Pratini de Moraes, said. "You fight recession with more trade, not with less trade."
The talks snagged for many hours on the sensitive issue of payments to European farmers, which at midnight, the French trade minister, Francois Huwart, called a "deal breaker." Nearly all parties had agreed that unless Europe promises to eliminate some $4 billion in annual export payments to its farmers, the talks will collapse.
But by this morning, Europe had accepted revised language in a draft text on agriculture in exchange for a proposal to conduct broader negotiations on environmental issues involved in trade, only to have the negotiations run into a fresh obstacle. India, which has strongly opposed beginning any negotiations on environmental issues, rejected the compromise, as did some African nations, leaving the talks in limbo nine hours after the deadline had passed.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, had already given ground on two trade issues that are highly sensitive to American businesses -- revising patent rules and allowing talks on antidumping measures. Those compromises propelled negotiations into the final stages and put heavy pressure on Europe, the other main proponent of global negotiations, to offer its own sacrifices.
Mr. Zoellick focused today on helping Europe win benefits in some contested areas that would allow it to claim success at the talks even after compromising on the farm question. Among these is Europe's desire to begin negotiations on competition and investment issues as well as the environment.
Critics fear that any attempt to dictate laws or regulations in those areas would intrude on sovereignty of nations and give a big advantage to large multinational companies.
But agreeing on talks about these so-called "new issues" -- even vaguely worded commitment to begin studying their relationship to trade -- was seen as pivotal to give Europeans the political cover they need.
"There's a sense that our issues are settled," an American trade official said. "Bob is spending his day on Europe."
It is not clear, however, that European concerns were the only remaining barrier.
The United States has come under pressure to accelerate reducing tariffs and increasing quotas on textiles and clothing, an issue of special importance to India, Pakistan and some southeast Asian nations.
Mr. Zoellick has already offered to make textiles and clothing a subject of negotiations in future years. But he has so far rejected demands to take immediate steps to increase market access for developing countries. There is some sentiment here that the United States may have to offer more on textiles as part of a multifaceted tradeoff in the final hours.
Some delegates also say India, which until China's entry into the trade group this weekend was the most populous and most influential developing country, has so far refused to accept any element of the proposed negotiating agenda. Its commerce minister, Murasoli Maran, "has just said no to everything," an American trade official said.
India has warned for months that it opposes a new round of talks, because, it says, developing countries have yet to receive the full benefits promised them earlier. But after days of talks, most other poor nations say they have a great deal to gain from the proposals under discussion here.
An American trade official said he was confident that India would not say no to new talks if it was faced with a "binary choice," meaning that it would not want to be seen as the one to veto the agenda if others agreed. But Indian officials have so far said little to justify that optimism.
The ministers have reached some significant agreements. On Monday, they settled an emotional battle over rules on drug patents that pitted African nations, as well as Brazil and India, against Switzerland, United States and some other industrial countries.
Some poor nations, backed by an aggressive campaign by health advocates, have argued that international rules to protect intellectual property have kept the price of essential medicines too high, making it impossible for the poor to afford lifesaving treatments for epidemic diseases like AIDS and malaria.
Drug companies, backed at times by the United States, argue that patents were not the problem and that the trade rules already allowed nations to violate patents if they faced health emergencies. The standoff exploded into an ideological North-South dispute over whether trade took precedence over the lives of the poor. 
The United States and several African nations agreed to a compromise on Monday, a settlement that was finished today, in the form of a political declaration that makes it clear that patents will not stand in the way of public health. 
Some drug companies complained that the implied exception to patent rules was too broad, reducing their incentive to develop medicines for the poorest countries.

Turning Away From the Holocaust

BYLINE:  By MAX FRANKEL; Max Frankel is a former executive editor of The Times.

 BODY:
AND then there was failure: none greater than the staggering, staining failure of The New York Times to depict Hitler's methodical extermination of the Jews of Europe as a horror beyond all other horrors in World War II -- a Nazi war within the war crying out for illumination.
 The annihilation of six million Jews would not for many years become distinctively known as the Holocaust. But its essence became knowable fast enough, from ominous Nazi threats and undisputed eyewitness reports collected by American correspondents, agents and informants. Indeed, a large number of those reports appeared in The Times. But they were mostly buried inside its gray and stolid pages, never featured, analyzed or rendered truly comprehensible. 
 Yet what they printed made clear that the editors did not long mistrust the ghastly reports. They presented them as true within months of Hitler's secret resolve in 1941 to proceed to the "final solution" of his fantasized "Jewish problem." 
Why, then, were the terrifying tales almost hidden in the back pages? Like most -- though not all -- American media, and most of official Washington, The Times drowned its reports about the fate of Jews in the flood of wartime news. Its neglect was far from unique and its reach was not then fully national, but as the premier American source of wartime news, it surely influenced the judgment of other news purveyors.
While a few publications -- newspapers like The Post (then liberal) and PM in New York and magazines like The Nation and The New Republic -- showed more conspicuous concern, The Times's coverage generally took the view that the atrocities inflicted upon Europe's Jews, while horrific, were not significantly different from those visited upon tens of millions of other war victims, nor more noteworthy.

Six Years, Six Page 1 Articles
Only six times in nearly six years did The Times's front page mention Jews as Hitler's unique target for total annihilation. Only once was their fate the subject of a lead editorial. Only twice did their rescue inspire passionate cries in the Sunday magazine.
Although The Times's news columns in those years did not offer as much analysis or synthesis as they do today, the paper took great pride in ranking the importance of events each morning and in carefully reviewing the major news of every week and every year. How could it happen that the war on the Jews never qualified for such highlighted attention?
There is no surviving record of how the paper's coverage of the subject was discussed by Times editors during the war years of 1939-45. But within that coverage is recurring evidence of a guiding principle: do not feature the plight of Jews, and take care, when reporting it, to link their suffering to that of many other Europeans.
This reticence has been a subject of extensive scholarly inquiry and also much speculation and condemnation. Critics have blamed "self-hating Jews" and "anti-Zionists" among the paper's owners and staff. Defenders have cited the sketchiness of much information about the death camps in Eastern Europe and also the inability of prewar generations to fully comprehend the industrial gassing of millions of innocents -- a machinery of death not yet exposed by those chilling mounds of Jews' bones, hair, shoes, rings.
No single explanation seems to suffice for what was surely the century's bitterest journalistic failure. The Times, like most media of that era, fervently embraced the wartime policies of the American and British governments, both of which strongly resisted proposals to rescue Jews or to offer them haven. After a decade of economic depression, both governments had political reasons to discourage immigration and diplomatic reasons to refuse Jewish settlements in regions like Palestine.
Then, too, papers owned by Jewish families, like The Times, were plainly afraid to have a society that was still widely anti-Semitic misread their passionate opposition to Hitler as a merely parochial cause. Even some leading Jewish groups hedged their appeals for rescue lest they be accused of wanting to divert wartime energies.
At The Times, the reluctance to highlight the systematic slaughter of Jews was also undoubtedly influenced by the views of the publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. He believed strongly and publicly that Judaism was a religion, not a race or nationality -- that Jews should be separate only in the way they worshiped. He thought they needed no state or political and social institutions of their own. He went to great lengths to avoid having The Times branded a "Jewish newspaper." He resented other publications for emphasizing the Jewishness of people in the news.
And it was his policy, on most questions, to steer The Times toward the centrist values of America's governmental and intellectual elites. Because his editorial page, like the American government and other leading media, refused to dwell on the Jews' singular victimization, it was cool to all measures that might have singled them out for rescue or even special attention.
Only once did The Times devote its lead editorial to the subject. That was on Dec. 2, 1942, after the State Department had unofficially confirmed to leading rabbis that two million Jews had already been slain and that five million more were indeed "in danger of extermination." Even that editorial, however, retreated quickly from any show of special concern. Insisting in its title that Jews were merely "The First to Suffer," it said the same fate awaited "people of other faiths and of many races," including "our own 'mongrel' nation" and even Hitler's allies in Japan if he were to win the war.
In only one 48-hour period, in early March 1943, was the paper moved to concede in multiple ways that Europe's Jews merited extraordinary attention. The impetus apparently came from Anne O'Hare McCormick, the foreign affairs columnist, a favorite of Sulzberger and a member of his editorial board, who thought that a Madison Square Garden rally pleading for the rescue of Jews had exposed "the shame of the world."
"There is not the slightest question," she wrote, "that the persecution of the Jews has reached its awful climax in a campaign to wipe them out of Europe. If the Christian community does not support to the utmost the belated proposal worked out to rescue the Jews remaining in Europe from the fate prepared for them, we have accepted the Hitlerian thesis and forever compromised the principles for which we are pouring out blood and wealth."
Beside her column on March 3, the last of seven editorials allowed that Hitler had condemned the Jews to death "where others are sometimes let off with slavery." Vaguely urging the United States to revise "the chilly formalism of its immigration regulations," it urged other free nations to let no "secondary considerations" bar entry of those refugees who might yet escape from the Nazis' control.
On the previous day, that same Garden rally was described in an exceptional half-page article, beginning with three paragraphs on Page 1 under the smallest of 11 front-page headlines:
SAVE DOOMED JEWS,
HUGE RALLY PLEADS
As never before or after, that day's coverage included long quotations from speeches and even the text of the rally's "resolution" calling for urgent measures to move Jews out of Hitler's grasp.
When more than a year later the editorial page returned to the subject and supported the idea of temporarily housing refugees in isolated American camps, it urged saving "innocent people" without ever using the word "Jew."
On its dense inside pages, however, The Times was much less hesitant about offering persuasive and gruesome details of the systematic murders of Jews. Hundreds of short items and scores of longer articles from different corners of Europe bore out the prophetic dispatch from the Berlin bureau that had appeared on Page 5 on Sept. 13, 1939, two weeks after Hitler invaded Poland:
NAZIS HINT PURGE
OF JEWS IN POLAND
"First intimations," it began, "that a solution of the 'Jewish problem' in Poland is on the German-Polish agenda are revealed in a 'special report' of the official German News Bureau." Given the report's claim that Polish Jewry "continually fortified and enlarged" Western Jewry, the Times correspondent added, it was hard to see how their "removal" would change things "without their extermination."
On March 1, 1942, just seven weeks after the notorious Wannsee Conference distributed orders about the mass-murder weapons to be used against Jews, an article on Page 28 bore this headline:
EXTINCTION FEARED
BY JEWS IN POLAND
Polish intellectuals and officials cited underground sources for the warning that 3.5 million Jews stood condemned "to cruel death -- to complete annihilation."
By June 13, the threat became official: "Nazis Blame Jews/For Big Bombings" read a headline on Page 7. The accompanying article quoted Joseph Goebbels as vowing that the Jews would pay for German suffering "with the extermination of their race in all Europe and perhaps even beyond Europe."
Two weeks later, two paragraphs appended to the end of a related article brought the news that "probably the greatest mass slaughter in history" had already claimed the lives of 700,000 Jews in Poland -- a slaughter employing "machine-gun bullets, hand grenades, gas chambers, concentration camps, whipping, torture instruments and starvation." By June 30, a brief item said the World Jewish Congress put the death toll at one million.
Still greater detail followed, on Page 6 of the July 2 issue, in a London report quoting the Polish government in exile. It cited the use of gas chambers to kill 1,000 Jews a day in different cities and the staging of a blood bath in the Warsaw ghetto. It said that "the criminal German government is fulfilling Hitler's threat that, whoever wins, all Jews will be murdered." Typically, the headline, "Allies Are Urged/To Execute Nazis," was no larger than that on a neighboring article about a Polish diplomat who died in a plunge on Riverside Drive.

Extermination Order on Page 10
On Nov. 25, a lengthy London dispatch on Page 10 cited roundups, gassings, cattle cars and the disappearance of 90 percent of Warsaw's ghetto population. It said Heinrich Himmler, the Gestapo head, had ordered the extermination of half of Poland's Jews before the end of 1942.
That same month, the State Department finally conceded that it had confirmed the extermination campaign but insisted that the Allies were helpless to prevent it. By Dec. 9, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was reported on Page 20 to have promised Jewish petitioners eventual punishment of the Nazi murderers. He was told that "the scientific and low-cost extermination" had claimed almost two million lives. There followed a rare front-page notice, on Dec. 18, under the smallest of a dozen headlines: "11 Allies Condemn/Nazi War on Jews." A brief editorial that day observed that this protest responded not just to the outcry of victims but to "officially established facts."
For once, The Times Magazine now felt free to offer a passionate plea for Europe's Jews. A brief essay by the novelist Sholem Asch on Feb. 7, 1943, recounted "the inhuman process of transportation in sealed, unventilated, limed freight cars, which are death traps."
"Those that survive," he wrote, "become as human waste to be thrown into mass-slaughter houses."
The magazine's next and last article on the subject, by Arthur Koestler on June 9, 1944, dealt mainly with the difficulty of comprehending "the greatest mass killing in recorded history."
Yet comparable emotion appeared in The Times only in a half dozen large advertisements pleading for "ACTION -- NOT PITY!" They were from groups urging the rescue of Jews or the formation of an avenging Jewish army in Palestine. Only passing notice recorded the mounting Jewish death toll: 3 million in August 1943, 4 million in July 1944, 5.5 million in November 1944.

Never the Lead Article of the Day
No article about the Jews' plight ever qualified as The Times's leading story of the day, or as a major event of a week or year. The ordinary reader of its pages could hardly be blamed for failing to comprehend the enormity of the Nazis' crime.
As Laurel Leff, an assistant professor at the Northeastern School of Journalism, has concluded, it was a tragic demonstration of how "the facts didn't speak for themselves." She has been the most diligent independent student of The Times's Holocaust coverage and deftly summarized her findings last year in The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics.
"You could have read the front page of The New York Times in 1939 and 1940," she wrote, "without knowing that millions of Jews were being sent to Poland, imprisoned in ghettos, and dying of disease and starvation by the tens of thousands. You could have read the front page in 1941 without knowing that the Nazis were machine-gunning hundreds of thousands of Jews in the Soviet Union.
"You could have read the front page in 1942 and not have known, until the last month, that the Germans were carrying out a plan to annihilate European Jewry. In 1943, you would have been told once that Jews from France, Belgium and the Netherlands were being sent to slaughterhouses in Poland and that more than half of the Jews of Europe were dead, but only in the context of a single story on a rally by Jewish groups that devoted more space to who had spoken than to who had died.
"In 1944, you would have learned from the front page of the existence of horrible places such as Maidanek and Auschwitz, but only inside the paper could you find that the victims were Jews. In 1945, liberated Dachau and Buchenwald were on the front page, but the Jews were buried inside."
A story buried but not, over time, forgotten.
After the Nazis' slaughter of Jews was fully exposed at war's end, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, the influential daughter, wife and mother of Times publishers, changed her mind about the need for a Jewish state and helped her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, accept the idea of Israel and befriend its leaders. Later, led by their son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, and their grandson Arthur Sulzberger Jr., The Times shed its sensitivity about its Jewish roots, allowed Jews to ascend to the editor's chair and warmly supported Israel in many editorials.
And to this day the failure of America's media to fasten upon Hitler's mad atrocities stirs the conscience of succeeding generations of reporters and editors. It has made them acutely alert to ethnic barbarities in far-off places like Uganda, Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo. It leaves them obviously resolved that in the face of genocide, journalism shall not have failed in vain.

GRAPHIC: Photos: DEAD, AND BURIED: On April 20, 1943, a Page 1 article about a conference on the "refugee problem" said nothing about Jews and asserted, inside, that refugees were being considered part of "a broad group," regardless of their religion. The execution of two million Jews was reported in an appended article of five paragraphs. During the height of the war, photographs of the Nazi death camps were not widely available; the one at top accompanied an article published in 1989.

150 and Counting: The Story So Far

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN; Robert D. McFadden is a senior writer on the metropolitan staff of The Times.

 BODY:
BEGINNINGS are apt to be inauspicious, and so they were in 1851 with Henry Jarvis Raymond's little newspaper. But over the last 150 years, as the nation endured wars, depressions and often painful political, economic and cultural growth, that paper survived competitive challenges, even brushes with death, and prospered beyond its founders' wildest dreams.
 As it marks its sesquicentennial this week, The New York Times -- centerpiece of a $3.5 billion conglomerate of newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations and Internet sites -- is widely regarded as America's most influential newspaper. Its news-gathering operations employ 1,000 journalists in New York and in dozens of domestic and foreign bureaus. Nearly 1.2 million daily copies of the paper -- nearly 1.7 million on Sundays -- are distributed in 200 metropolitan areas across the nation, and the readers are among the best-educated, most affluent people in America. 
 Destiny? Surely not. The Times's evolution is a complex and paradoxical story, of steadfastness and willingness to change, of owners and their staffs espousing core values of fairness, accuracy and impartiality, while evolving their ideas of who the readers are and what they want and need, in adapting to new technologies and in redefining fundamental concepts of the news and how to present it. Indeed, The Times has redefined and reinvented itself many times. 
In recent years, Times readers have become accustomed to a supermarket of information in a big multisection paper packed with world, national, suburban and city news and a panoply of sports, business, arts, entertainment, science and other subjects. There is something for everyone, stylishly written. Page 1 is a sharp focus on a complicated world; it carries only six or seven articles, news and illuminating features, with color pictures and graphics, all placed and sized to show the weight accorded by editors to current events. Most readers of The Times, already aware of breaking news from broadcast and Internet sources, want and are given news in depth, often with analysis and interpretation.

Lots of Facts and Long Sentences
But for much of the 20th century, The Times rather aloofly regarded itself as America's paper of record and presented the news as if from on high. It was solidly reported and accurate, but was a daunting compendium of facts recited on pages of unrelieved seriousness. Coverage was heavy on government and world affairs, but short on analysis; the writing was ponderous, with long sentences and dangling phrases. Humor was rare, as if it lacked significance. Politics was written for politicians, not voters. A typical front page was a picket fence of narrow columns filled with 15 or 20 articles, often without pictures or other signs of life. Inside was another gray vault, often bearing lists: market prices, arriving ships, votes in Congress, new books, out-of-town buyers -- all useful, but in what way? That was left to the reader to decide.
Until the 1920's, reporters were paid for the number of words they got into print, an arrangement that spared them the task of digesting news, encouraged them to include every last detail and sometimes masked mental laziness in a guise of thoroughness. And for most of its 19th-century history, The Times was a primitive version of journalistic responsibility -- a prudent voice that gave news impartially and authoritatively, but cast it in florid phrases and stacked it, page after page, in long columns relieved only by label headlines: "Awful Event" (Abraham Lincoln's assassination), "The Secret Accounts" (Boss Tweed's skulduggery) or simply "The News From Europe."
Raymond's Times was apparently modeled on The Times of London, known then as a wellspring of integrity, and it embodied many of the qualities that would make it famous -- an unsensational view of the news, an avoidance of partisanship and bombast, a mannerly tone and thorough reporting. Raymond also pledged to avoid bitter personal feuds, which embroiled the city's other journals and obliged some editors to face off in duels or fistfights.
Seven previous papers called The Times had failed in New York between 1813 and Sept. 18, 1851, when the New-York Daily Times was founded. Raymond's version, for all its high-mindedness, faced daunting odds in a city of 500,000 (mostly living below 14th Street), which already had dozens of papers and teemed with businesses, crowded tenements, piers lined with ships and muddy streets awash with adventurers, greenhorns, whiskey-soaked toughs and thundering preachers. The new Times lacked the bite of James Gordon Bennett's raucous Herald and the zest of Horace Greeley's Tribune. But within 10 days, it claimed a circulation of 10,000, including "the most respectable families in town." And in a year circulation had doubled, to 20,000.
The Times's excellent coverage of the Civil War added greatly to its prestige in the 1860's. While he continued to edit The Times, Raymond became an important figure in Republican politics during the war, serving as party chairman, helping Andrew Johnson secure the vice presidency and winning a term in Congress. Editors now would see such activity as a clear conflict of interest.

The Fall of Lincoln, and of Tweed
The Times extensively reported the assassination of Lincoln in 1865, including a lead article by Edwin M. Stanton, the secretary of war. Allowing a government official to write a major news article seems ridiculous; even then the press saw itself as a watchdog, not a partner, of government, but there were often egregious lapses.
While The Times was generally not a crusading paper, it began an investigation in 1870 that exposed the multimillion-dollar schemes of William Marcy Tweed, boss of the Tammany Hall Democratic organization. Ignoring death threats, bribe offers and advertising boycotts, The Times -- by now without "Daily" in its name -- published accounts of fraudulent public works contracts and toppled Tweed and his ring. The exploit became a journalistic legend.
More typically, The Times chronicled the great changes in the city as the 19th century moved toward its close: the Dickensian gloom fading as arc lamps replaced gaslight on Broadway, a new elevated train rumbling up Third Avenue, the Brooklyn Bridge being constructed high over the East River and New York's population swelling with immigrants and a host of social and economic problems.
By 1893, a depression had settled over New York, and The Times began to lose its financial advertising, a chief source of revenue. By 1896 it was $300,000 in debt, circulation had plummeted to 9,000 and it was for sale. Its life hung in the balance. Adolph S. Ochs, a young newspaperman from Chattanooga, Tenn., saw it as an opportunity and bought a controlling interest for $75,000.
It was a bold idea. At the time, the claimed circulations of the major competitors were 400,000 for The Evening World; 300,000 for The Morning Journal; 200,000, The (Morning) World; 145,000, The News; 140,000, The Herald; 130,000, The Evening Journal; 70,000, The Morning Sun; 60,000, The Evening Sun; 19,000, The Post; 18,000, The Press; 16,000, The Tribune; and 12,000 The Advertiser.
To imagine that all these newspapers, excepting The Post (the present Daily News was begun in 1919), would be dead someday and The Times pre-eminent in the world would have been madness in 1896. But the Ochs purchase was the beginning of a family ownership that not only saw it all happen but also marked its own centennial at the head of the newspaper in 1996 and is now in its fifth generation. 
Though not a journalist himself, Ochs was a deft businessman and shared the values that had sustained The Times -- a belief that readers wanted straight news, thoroughly reported, reflecting all sides in a controversy and written without the biases that infected other papers.
The Times, Ochs said, would be "an independent newspaper, entirely fearless, devoted to the public welfare without regard to individual advantage or ambition, the claims of party politics or personal prejudice or predilection." To sum it up, he coined the Page 1 motto "All the News That's Fit to Print." And he dropped the hyphen in the Times logo.
Ochs greatly expanded business and financial news, printing market prices, news on ship movements and lists of arriving out-of-town buyers useful to wholesalers and manufacturers. He began publishing real estate transactions and news on education and books, as well as the routine affairs of commerce and government. He began a letters-to-the-editor column, a poets' corner, a Saturday literary supplement and a Sunday illustrated supplement, forerunners of the Book Review and the magazine section.

Catching Einstein in an Error
In 1904, in a step that would prove crucial, Ochs hired Carr Van Anda from The Sun as managing editor. Over the next 25 years, the Ochs-Van Anda team carried The Times to new heights of achievement. A man of wide learning, Van Anda once spotted an error in a calculation by Albert Einstein and detected a forgery in a hieroglyphic supposedly 4,000 years old.
As wireless communications revolutionized the accessibility and speed of news from faraway places, The Times leaped on the advantages. In 1904, it ran news of the first naval engagement of the Russian-Japanese War in a dispatch datelined, "Off Port Arthur, On Board The Times Steamship Haimun." With the opening of the Marconi Transatlantic Wireless Service in 1907, European news grew voluminous.
By 1912, with circulation at 200,000, The Times was becoming the most important newspaper in the country. Still conservative in appearance, it rarely published pictures or used banner headlines -- except when major news broke, as it did on April 16.
"Titanic Sinks Four Hours After Hitting Iceberg," the headline declared. The article's wording was typically convoluted. "The admission that the Titanic, the biggest steamship in the world, had been sunk by an iceberg and had gone to the bottom of the Atlantic, probably carrying more than 1,400 of her passengers and crew with her, was made at the White Star Line offices, 9 Broadway, at 8:20 o'clock last night." 
The newspaper's reputation for complete, accurate coverage was solidified in World War I. Disregarding the costs of cable and travel and other reportorial expenses, and led by Edwin L. James, its chief war correspondent, The Times detailed every thrust and parry, from the first shots in Sarajevo and the sinking of the Lusitania to America's plunge into the conflict and the Treaty of Versailles, whose full text it printed exclusively.
Sparing no expense and pouring the profits back into the paper became a hallmark of the Ochs stewardship. By 1920, after 24 years, profits had totaled more than $100 million; all but $4 million had been used by Ochs to expand and improve The Times.
The paper's reserved use of big headlines and picture layouts became a standard by which readers, and even other news media, judged the relative importance of events. While other journals numbed readers with hyperbole and inflated typographical splashes day after day, The Times's approach portrayed an orderly world encompassed by a historic framework.
While The Times usually saved its displays for extraordinary events -- war and peace, elections, deaths of popes and presidents, revolutions and historic scientific exploits -- there were occasional lapses in judgment, some almost incredible. For reasons hard to explain today, perhaps something to do with manhood in a sporting age of flappers, Prohibition and soaring stock markets after the Great War, Times editors in the 1920's demonstrated an astonishing fixation on heavyweight title prizefights.

A Broken Thumb in Big Type
On July 3, 1921, a Times banner -- three lines across the top of Page 1 -- proclaimed: "Dempsey Knocks Out Carpentier in the Fourth Round; Challenger Breaks His Thumb Against Champion's Jaw; Record Crowd of 90,000 Orderly and Well Handled." Eight articles on the fight -- on the blow to the jaw, the broken thumb, demands for Dempsey's arrest, even Dempsey's telegram to his mother -- filled six of the eight columns. These displays were repeated on Sept. 24, 1926, when Gene Tunney beat Jack Dempsey for the title, and on Sept. 23, 1927, when Tunney beat Dempsey in the rematch.
In the 1920's and 30's, The Times only occasionally identified its writers with bylines; in the first 50 years of the paper's life, signed articles were almost nonexistent. Thus the Russian revolution, the Civil War, the loss of the Titanic and much of World War I were reported anonymously.
The effect was to heighten a sense of awe and mystery about the newspaper, creating an illusion that the institution, not talented journalists, was responsible for its achievements. In the 40's most war correspondents were accorded bylines for outstanding work, but much of the paper -- except columnists and critics -- was still wreathed in gray, incognito prose. Since the 50's, The Times, its institutional name forever secure, has put bylines on most major news articles by staff members. The average reader pays little attention to bylines -- although those with specialized interests often look to specialists' bylines -- but reporters value them to enhance their own standing with news sources and, to a lesser extent, for peer recognition. Reporters in a more cynical age used to say that a byline and a dime would get you a cup of coffee.
In 1935, The Times added two important innovations to its coverage. One was wirephotos -- pictures transmitted over telephone lines. The first wirephoto, of survivors of a dirigible explosion off San Francisco, amazed readers and competitors, who wondered how The Times got the picture across the country in hours.
The second addition was a weekly section reviewing the news, which grew to become much more -- a section devoted to interpretation, analysis and commentary -- as the decades passed and a glut of information threatened to swamp readers.
After Ochs died in 1935, his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, became publisher. Over the next 26 years, he and his managing editors, Edwin L. James and Turner Catledge, continued traditions of thorough, impartial reporting -- on the Depression, World War II and the Korean War. But there were bad lapses.
Like most of America, The Times paid scant attention to reports that Hitler was annihilating European Jews. While much of the paper's reporting on the persecution of Jews was thorough, crucial Holocaust news was buried. On Nov. 25, 1942, for example, a small article on Page 10 reported that two million European Jews had been killed, and a July 1944 report that 400,000 Hungarian Jews had been deported to death camps ran at only four inches on Page 12. Many newspapers were skeptical of such reports, suspecting they were exaggerated by groups seeking relief funds. But critics said that if The Times, with its influence and capabilities, had acted differently, Americans would have awakened to the atrocities sooner.
A decade later, when Senators Joseph R. McCarthy and James O. Eastland were charging that Communists and their sympathizers had infiltrated the government, Hollywood, the news media and other American institutions, The Times and other newspapers, still trying to be objective, uncritically reported what proved to be largely fabricated allegations. Editorially, The Times later denounced both senators for demagoguery and for trying to intimidate a free press. The experience helped move The Times toward more interpretive news writing.
In 1961, Arthur Hays Sulzberger retired and was succeeded by his son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, whose brief stewardship included The Times's coverage of the Cuban missile crisis. When Dryfoos died in 1963, the leadership of The Times passed to Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the son of Arthur Hays Sulzberger. Over the next 29 years the paper underwent dramatic changes while covering major news of the century: the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement, the Pentagon Papers and the Watergate scandals, moon landings, the collapse of Soviet Communism and the end of the cold war.
Publication of the Pentagon Papers -- a 7,000-page secret government history of the Vietnam War showing that successive administrations had hidden the conflict's true causes and dimensions -- was a historic achievement for The Times. The Nixon administration tried to suppress the documents, but the Supreme Court, in a landmark case, upheld the primacy of the press against government attempts to halt publication.

Another Near-Death Experience
As a backdrop for these feats, The Times had its second brush with death, and was guided back to even greater prosperity through a minefield of labor strikes, technology that revolutionized production and communications, changing readership interests, a national transformation of the once-local advertising base and a metamorphosis that changed the paper's content and look while maintaining its essential character.
Strikes by printers, news and editorial staffs and other unionized workers in the 1960's sent several of New York's newspapers to the graveyard. By the end of the decade, even The Times stood on shaky ground. Its pages were old-fashioned, its news writing still ponderous. Revenues, heavily reliant on department-store advertising, were declining. Circulation was stagnant. Some studies said The Times might be doomed in the television age if it failed to control soaring production and labor costs.
But in 1974, the management negotiated contracts that provided lifetime jobs as well as buyouts for many blue-collar employees and gave the paper the right to automate much of its production, cutting labor expenses markedly. Soon, clanking typesetting machines were gone, along with metal type and the whole paper culture of the newsroom -- typewriters, copy paper, spindles, pencils, erasers and an elaborate system of pneumatic tubes to shoot capsules of edited copy to the composing room. Gone too was the newspaper's morgue -- a treasury of yellowed, flaking clippings, filed and cross-filed for ready reference.
In their place were computers to write, to edit, to set "cold" type, to transmit words and pictures around the world, to perform research and store the institutional memory, even to do the legwork for beat and investigative reporters.
Beginning in the 70's, The Times underwent a transformation that erased a stodgy image, improved readability and restored profits. Its sober pages were enlivened with brighter writing and layouts; news coverage was intensified, and specialists were hired to cover subjects like medicine, computer sciences, financial affairs, law and government, education and the fine and performing arts. The paper was expanded, with new weekday sections on sports, science, food, home furnishings and entertainment. At first, critics called these sections frivolous, but Times executives defended them as stylish and said they took no space from regular news. They proved highly popular with readers and advertisers.
The Times also began a Sunday guide for television listings and introduced suburban weekly sections for New Jersey, Westchester County, Connecticut and Long Island. It also brought out Sunday Magazine supplements that focused on subjects like education, fashion, health, leisure activities, travel and home entertainment and design.
Since 1980, when the paper first began publishing a national edition, The Times has widened its reach and circulation, enlarged its advertising base and established a network of printing plants and production-and-distribution partnerships with newspapers and delivery companies. One result has been the achievement of a longstanding goal: transformation of The New York Times into a truly national newspaper.
Today, pages are beamed by satellite from New York to printing centers nationwide to provide same-day delivery to readers in 200 metropolitan areas. Nearly half of its circulation -- almost 500,000 on weekdays and nearly 800,000 on Sundays -- lies outside the New York metropolitan area.
Advertising, the backbone of newspaper revenue, has also been transformed. Once reliant on New York City advertisers, and subject to the ups and downs of the local economy, The Times is increasingly a repository of national advertising by computer makers, financial concerns, airlines and other national companies. National ad revenue jumped to 82 percent last year from 31 percent in 1996, making the paper far less vulnerable to dips in particular sectors. (The average share of national advertising in American newspapers is 17 percent.)

A Little Rouge Amid the Gray
As anyone who has ever worked for or against The Times will tell you, the paper is universally and reverently known as the Gray Lady of 43rd Street. Her traditions -- seriousness, genteel taste, fairness, the chiaroscuro look -- account for the description.
But traditions aside, "Gray Lady" is no longer quite apt. In 1997, The Times introduced color to the daily pages, one of many innovations under Arthur Sulzberger Jr., who succeeded his father as publisher in 1992. The presses in The Times's building on 43rd Street, its headquarters since 1913, rolled for the last time in 1997. Automated plants in Edison, N.J., and College Point, Queens, have taken their place.
Redesigned sections -- Dining In/Dining Out, House & Home, Weekend, Circuits -- have been added. And The Times has deepened its involvement in the Internet, establishing Web sites under New York Times Digital. Continuous News made its debut last year, to supply Internet users with news from Times resources. Joint productions with television news organizations have taken The Times into additional ventures.
Last year, The Times announced that the architect Renzo Piano had been selected to design a new home for the newspaper -- a gossamer skyscraper of about 50 stories on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets scheduled for completion in 2005.
Turning the pages of a coffee-table book of famous front pages of The New York Times, with their banner headlines, it is easy to be caught up in the sweep of history: war and peace, that atomic bomb, men on the moon. They are indeed the great stories of the age, reflecting momentous occasions and traditions that have brought The Times and members of its staff 81 Pulitzer Prizes.
But it is good to remember that, in the scramble against the deadline, it was all just news.

Beyond (and Behind) the Stock Tables

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS AND CHRISTINE BOCKELMANN; Floyd Norris, the chief financial correspondent of The Times, and Christine Bockelmann edited "The New York Times Century of Business," published in 1999 by McGraw-Hill

 BODY:
WHEN the New-York Daily Times made its debut on Sept. 18, 1851, it provided what was deemed to be a requirement of a serious newspaper, even then: stock tables and an article on what had moved the market.
 Of course, the markets were a bit smaller then than they are now. There was one exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, and the newspaper's stock table listed just 60 securities, most of them bonds. The previous day's activities seem to have been pretty dull. 
 Other markets were also "Carefully Reported for The Daily Times," as the paper headed its daily report on what might now be called commodities. Prices for ashes were "extremely firm," but the wheat market was "somewhat depressed." 
There were few big businesses then, except the growing railroads. But coverage grew as business did, and as technology -- from electricity to telephones to automobiles to the Internet -- changed the world.
Today, business and financial news is everywhere. Coverage reflects the increasing sophistication of the reader as investor, consumer, employer, employee, homeowner and more. In the weeks that followed the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, the market reaction, and the disaster's effects on the economy, were major elements of the continuing story.
Rules requiring businesses to disclose far more about themselves have made it much easier for reporters to obtain information, analyze it and pass it along to readers. So has the advent of the Internet. The growing sense that business is a powerful factor in shaping ordinary lives has whetted readers' appetites to know more.
From the beginning, The Times has taken readers' interests to heart in its own distinctive ways. Determined not to be a scandal sheet, the paper has tended to cover financial crises with the aim of not making them worse. The 1929 stock market crash led the paper day after day, but each day's headline found at least one reassuring element even as the articles described the collapse of prices. Front-page coverage of the 1987 crash included an article dismissing the likelihood of another depression.

Muting the Alarms
The Times's approach to the first major financial crisis it covered, in 1857, set the tone. Only short articles inside the paper told of the great distress on Wall Street, and an editorial on Aug. 27 proclaimed that the panic "is not a serious interruption of the ordinary channel of prosperous enterprise, but a threatened stampede of terrified stockholders, operators and directors." It blamed alarmist reporting in the rival Tribune for helping to stir the panic.
To The Times, the day's major news was the progress in laying the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. "The establishment of an Electric Telegraph between the Old and the New Continents," read a front-page article, "is obviously an enterprise which has no precedent in the annals of mechanical engineering; the object proposed being nothing less than the commercial annihilation of distance in respect to one of the great Gulfs which have been placed between the East and the West -- the opposite halves of the habitable world."
Not that the early Times always played down financial crises. In 1869, when Jay Gould tried to corner the market in gold, the paper reported prominently and in great detail on the price movements -- and on the rumors of what was really behind them. By the panic of 1901, Wall Street's huge gyrations were major news, and The Times made no effort to minimize their severity. "Disaster and Ruin in Falling Market" was the lead headline on May 10. That panic arose over a battle for control of the Northern Pacific Railroad, with E. H. Harriman on one side and J. P. Morgan on the other.
In serving readers as investors and as consumers, newspapers now routinely report on profits and analyze corporate operations and balance sheets, but such articles were very unusual, in The Times and elsewhere, until the 1930's, when the federal government required companies to issue regular financial reports.
But another aspect of what is now expected in business pages -- scrutiny of top executives -- was a staple by the early 1900's, as giant trusts came to dominate many industries. There were calls for government action to break up the trusts, but there was also a fascination with the men who stood astride the world of finance, accumulating fortunes beyond most readers' imagining.
Thus on Dec. 20, 1912, when the lead article was about J. P. Morgan's testimony before a Congressional committee investigating what was called the "money trust," the front page also reported that John D. Rockefeller -- who did not need to be identified as the head of the giant Standard Oil Company -- had played a round of golf. "To-day he beat his record of 44 by one stroke, and he was as pleased over the feat as if he had made another million," the article reported. It did not mention how many holes were played -- nine, presumably.

Skewers and Bonbons
The Times, like much of America, was fascinated by business titans. In 1905, The Times printed excerpts of a book by Andrew Carnegie in three Sunday magazine sections. "The manual worker is as proud of his work, and rightly so, as men are in other vocations," wrote the steel magnate in one excerpt, "The Romance of Labor." He told the story of a maid who was thrilled "to have the honor" of shining a famous man's boots. "Happy girl in her work, knowing that all service is honorable."
But The Times could skewer business, too. In 1906, Upton Sinclair's novel "The Jungle" shocked America with its expos 1/8 of unsanitary conditions in the meatpacking industry and led to the first federal meat inspection law. It also inspired The Times Magazine to publish a satire, "Extracts From 'The Jungle' as the Packers Would Have Written It," signed only by "Y."
The essay told of an immigrant laborer who was hired in the Potted Ham Department at a meatpacking company. "Jurgis could hardly believe his ears. He, Jurgis Rawcuss, unskilled, uneducated, and but recently sterilized, was to help make the most carefully prepared, the purest, the most delicious food known to mankind!" So impressed was the immigrant by the cleanliness he saw, he almost immediately became a citizen and a patriotic American.
Innovations were often at the top of the news, although no paper could be sure which would become important. In 1946, for example, The Times gave front-page display to a report on "an amazing machine" known as "the electronic numerical integrator and computer" -- the pioneering Eniac. Two years later the invention of "a device called a transistor" merited four paragraphs on the radio page.
Radio had become the rage in the 1920's, and it was covered voluminously by The Times. It was viewed as a revolutionary technology with amazing potential, much as the Internet is viewed now. Like the Internet, it provoked a great era of speculation on Wall Street. In 1925 Alexander D. Noyes, the paper's best-known business writer, wrote of the "speculative mania" gripping the public, and forecast that prices would fall. The warning was four years premature.
When the crash came, The Times reported somberly on Oct. 30, 1929: "Wall Street was a street of vanished hopes, of curiously silent apprehension and of a sort of paralyzed hypnosis yesterday. Men and women crowded the brokerage offices, even those who have been long since wiped out, and followed the figures on the tape. Little groups gathered here and there to discuss the fall in prices in hushed and awed tones. They were participating in the making of financial history. It was the consensus of bankers and brokers alike that no such scenes ever again will be witnessed by this generation."
An editorial described the crash as an "inevitable sequel" to an "orgy of speculation." But it voiced confidence that the Federal Reserve Board would be able to ensure that Wall Street's woes would not spread to the rest of the economy.
Today, as in the early decades, The Times covers both the big financial crises and the trends that could change how people live. It has chronicled new technologies as diverse as air-conditioning, which transformed America by making large parts of the country comfortably habitable, and biotechnology, which has raised both life expectancy and the fears of experimenting with life.
What has changed is the quantity of business news, as investors choose among thousands of stocks and as corporations affect people around the globe. The Times began its Business Day section in 1978; by now there is more business coverage in a single day than there was in months of the paper's early decades. The goal, however, has never changed. It is to bring home to readers how the world of business and finance affects their lives.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Money Matters: Readers in the 1930's benefited from corporate disclosure laws that got behind the billboards (John Gutmann); COULD BE WORSE: Like much of The Times's coverage of financial crises over the decades, a 1929 headline sought to give the good news along with the bad. But there was no ignoring the effects of the Great Depression, like this bread line in Lower Manhattan in 1935.

When Newspapers Were Newsmakers

BYLINE:  By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD; John Noble Wilford is a senior science writer for The Times.

 BODY:
I MAKE news," boasted James Gordon Bennett Jr. He was full of himself, as usual. But make news he did, with deep pockets and commanding zeal. As owner of The New York Herald after the Civil War, Bennett would not wait for news to just happen. He dispatched reporters far and wide with orders to send back sensational copy of adventure and discovery, anything to capture the essence of a time of expanding horizons and, not incidentally, to win readers away from the competition.
 It was what editors did in the rough-and-tumble of journalism when The New-York Times was striving to secure a foothold: when they went out of their way to "make" news, the papers became participants in what they were reporting. The practice continues to this day, though rarely with the showmanship of a Bennett. 
 Only purists with blinkers would argue that journalists do not have an impact on the news they write about -- or that they could avoid it. A decision to cover one thing and not another makes news of one and non-news of the other. 
Over time, The Times found its own niche. It made news, but in a way that proved adaptable to the changes in exploration and adventure brought about by advances in science, aviation and technology.
No paper, of course, could have matched Bennett's first and greatest exploit. In 1869, a century before the moon landings, he summoned a reporter, Henry M. Stanley, and ordered him, "Find Livingstone." For three years, there had been no direct word from David Livingstone, the British missionary lost in deepest Africa.
Stanley, heading a search party, became the leading participant in the story. When he finally found his man in 1871, it was his own words -- not anything the missionary said -- that left an indelible mark: "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"
Near the end of the 19th century, another titan of journalism, William Randolph Hearst, whipped up a frenzy of support for war with Spain over Cuba and deployed his crack correspondent, Richard Harding Davis, and the artist Frederic Remington to Havana to file on the first shots. But Washington and Madrid seemed less eager for combat than Hearst. After a long wait, Remington cabled: "There is no trouble here. There will be no war. Wish to return." To which the bellicose Hearst supposedly responded: "Please remain. You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war."
Whether or not Hearst actually used those words, they were in the spirit of the man and of journalism in those years. This may not be how journalists see themselves today, but that was not the last time they took an active role in the dialogue of war, politics or domestic security. Think of The Washington Post bringing down a president with its Watergate reporting, or The Times (followed by The Washington Post), in defiance of White House pressure, publishing the Pentagon Papers on the conduct of the war in Southeast Asia.
In the last decades of the 19th century, The Times remained for the most part on the sidelines as the more colorful press engaged in journalistic adventuring. The paper had emerged from the Civil War with a reputation for sober, thorough reporting. The paper's one serious foray into Bennett-style adventurism was a series of exclusive accounts by an Army explorer in Alaska in 1886, billed as "The Times' Alaska Expedition." But this paled in comparison with Bennett's three-year search about the same time for remnants of the ill-fated John Franklin expedition in northern Canada.
The appeal of the remote unexplored corners of the world eventually drew The Times into the game of expedition exclusives with increasing vigor and success. The man largely responsible was Carr Van Anda, the managing editor in the early 20th century and a gifted mathematician fascinated with science and exploration.
With the backing of his publisher, Adolph S. Ochs, Van Anda lined up, over 25 years, the polar explorers Robert E. Peary and Richard E. Byrd, as well as the aviator Charles A. Lindbergh. In the 1930's, editors signed up William Beebe for the report of his descent in a bathysphere to the seafloor, and Auguste Piccard for the account of his balloon ascent into the stratosphere.
The paper's practice was not to mount its own expeditions, but if someone had organized and secured substantial financing for a project, then The Times would invest modestly in return for exclusive rights to publish a first-person account. The paper was not so much making news as collaborating in spreading it.
In the first of these arrangements, Peary accepted the paper's offer of $4,000 for New York rights to an account of his 1909 expedition, trumpeted as the "discovery of the North Pole." His first message, triumphant if not necessarily quite accurate, was sent part of the way by wireless, itself a notable achievement.

The Flipper in the Loch
Aviation was the rage in the 20's, and Times reporters kept busy with accounts of record-setting flights and disastrous failures. Byrd's flight in 1926 with Floyd Bennett, to a point close to the North Pole if not actually over it, was described in another Times exclusive. When Lindbergh made his trans-Atlantic flight to Paris from Long Island, The Times had a $5,000 contract for his own detailed story.
The reporter as adventurer, in the Stanley mold, lives only in memory. The Spirit of St. Louis rests in the Smithsonian, and Paris is only a drink, meal and movie away on a jumbo jet. Scientists and reporters, even tourists, regularly fly in and out of Antarctica. A man in California recently paid for a trip to the International Space Station. Where are the sensations of yesteryear?
There is, of course, the occasional throwback. In 1976, an editor on the foreign desk of The Times read an article of mine about a picture purporting to show the flipper of a large creature in Loch Ness, Scotland. In an earlier time, the editor said, a newspaper would send an expedition to find Nessie. So began what became known as the New York Times Loch Ness Expedition.
Waste no time seeking parallels between this and Stanley's search for Livingstone. The pier from which we put out in boats to sweep the deep waters with sonar and the little house where we monitored video from submerged cameras were just down the road from a comfortable hotel with a well-stocked pub, where the Nessie legend was refueled nightly. Every few days I transmitted an article filled with the excitement of anticipated discovery, but Nessie was a no-show. Still, The Times and I had made news. Reporters descended on the lochside village, and where there is a critical mass of journalists, there is news.
On returning from Scotland, I covered the spacecraft landings on Mars, where Martian microbes proved as elusive as Nessie. Here was an example of the new exploration. Only governments can afford expeditions into space and investigations of cosmic origins, and all but a few ventures to the poles and the seafloor. These are national and international endeavors, driven by science and a perceived political and economic need to be at the front of modern technology.
In exploration today, no publication can buy exclusive rights to a government project. Yet reporters are still making news, though with a difference. For science journalists in particular, the difference is in bringing research from the lab and the field to the front page, rescuing it from obscurity in language accessible to the public.
This may not match finding Livingstone, but the implications can be greater. The Times has taken a leading role in this type of journalism, from the time of Van Anda through the introduction of the weekly Science Times in 1978. At Van Anda's instigation, the reporter Alva Johnston spent three days in 1922 at a wide-ranging science conference, listening to reports, interviewing scientists and writing a number of well-informed articles about research that probably would not otherwise have reached public attention. They were exclusives because no reporter had before deemed such science to be news. Johnston was the first science reporter to win a Pulitzer Prize.
In the late 30's, William L. Laurence, a Times science reporter, put two and two together and came so close to recognizing the possibilities of an atomic bomb that in the midst of World War II the government asked that he be detached from the newspaper for a secret assignment. Laurence was given the only inside story of the Manhattan Project, on the condition that nothing be published until the bomb had been dropped.
Walter Sullivan once wrote an article about the first detection of radiation from the birth of the universe in the Big Bang; the scientists themselves later said they had not fully appreciated the significance of their research until they read the report in The Times.
So it is today, with issues like cloning, genome mapping, clinical trials for drugs, global warming and prospects for biological warfare -- subjects already in the news but crying out for interpretation on a newsmaking scale. Every science reporter here fields calls from bewildered but pleased scientists whose research has been the subject of a Times article. They have been besieged for days with requests for other newspaper and magazine interviews, television appearances and sometimes book contracts. That's making news, reverberating news, today's way.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Several agencies are trying a variety of methods to reflect the world after Sept. 11.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
SEVERAL agencies are becoming known as specialists in a new kind of advertising, producing a variety of work seeking to reflect the changed national reality after Sept. 11.
 Some agencies are producing public service campaigns, some are producing campaigns for paying clients and some are commissioning surveys and studies to assess the changes in consumer attitudes and behavior since the terrorist attacks. Some of the work is serious, some is humorous; some of the ads speak like a cheerleader, others like a sage. 
 Executives of the agencies involved say they are aware of the fine line in circumstances like these between opportunity and opportunism, between rising to a challenge and leaping to cash in. They describe their efforts, which they compare to crisis communications for companies in distress, as necessary to serve marketers required suddenly to reassess all advertising messages. 
"It has to be done in a delicate way," said Philip B. Dusenberry, chairman for the North American operations of BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group. "You have to strike the right note, the right tone."
"It's important not to seem self-serving or self-aggrandizing," he added. "We're just there to help our clients."
BBDO has produced paid ads addressing the Sept. 11 aftermath for General Electric, the New York Stock Exchange and Visa, as well as a pro bono campaign on behalf of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani carrying the theme "The New York miracle. Be a part of it," to promote tourism during the holidays. That campaign, composed of six television commercials featuring quintessential New York personalities like Woody Allen and Yogi Berra engaged in unlikely pursuits, has been widely praised for its humor and special effects.
"Making an emotional connection with consumers is especially important now," said Steven Blamer, president and chief executive at the New York office of Grey Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group. This week, his agency introduced a 60-second commercial for the Postal Service, that organization's first advertising since canceling all campaigns after the anthrax scare. The spot uses the Carly Simon song "Let the River Run" to portray postal workers in heroic fashion, i.e., doing their jobs.
"It shows our employees doing what they do every day, now in the face of adversity," said Larry Speakes, advertising manager at the Postal Service.
The commercial is the initial work by Grey after its parent, Grey Global, began posting last month on its Web site (www.grey.com) a series of "white papers" related to Sept. 11, and addressed to advertisers. The papers are written by executives from Grey Global agencies around the world that specialize in services like advertising, public relations and interactive marketing.
"This assignment for the Postal Service grew out of many things we talked about on the Web site," Mr. Blamer said, like advice from Steven Novick, vice chairman and chief creative officer at Grey Global, to not "make the product the hero" but rather focus on people; to "watch the flag-waving"; and to avoid giving worried, distracted consumers "an overproduced piece of advertising."
Simplicity and familiarity are the watchwords for campaigns from the New York and Toronto offices of the Wolf Group that encourage tourists to visit New York. The New York office's campaign is sponsored to the tune of $40 million by the Empire State Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The television spots reinterpret the development organization's famous "I Love New York" campaign; in one scene, Mr. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki urge visitors to "come see New York united in its finest hour."
The Toronto office's campaign, produced pro bono, also revisits the "I Love New York" theme, which becomes "Canada Loves New York" and encourages Canadians to visit the city en masse the weekend of Nov. 30-Dec. 2 by taking advantage of special lower prices on plane and bus tickets and hotel rooms.
A print ad, showing the Statue of Liberty clad in the Canadian flag, declares, "There will never be a more inexpensive time to visit New York." A commercial, shown on television and in movie theaters, features Canadian celebrities known to Americans -- like Dan Aykroyd, Kim Cattrall, Wayne Gretzky, Eric Lindros, Jason Priestley, William Shatner and Alex Trebek -- making remarks like "I'm Canadian and I love New York" and "J'adore New York"; the prime minister, Jean Chretien, even appears, saying, "Canada, show your support."
Large Canadian media companies including Bell GlobeMedia, CanWest Global Communications, Rogers Communications and the Torstar Media Group are donating an estimated 3 million to 5 million Canadian dollars worth of commercial time and ad space to run the campaign.
"The Canadian work was inspired by the New York work," said Larry Wolf, chairman and chief executive at Wolf Group, who is Canadian and based in Toronto. "What we tried to do is capture the spirit of 'I Love New York' from a Canadian perspective."
"It's important to get life back to what it was," he added, "or else the bad guys somehow win."
Another agency that has produced work related to the new reality is McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
One commercial by the agency's New York office, produced pro bono for the Advertising Council, features Laura Bush, the first lady, asking Americans to take time to talk to their children about the events of Sept. 11. That office also created a public service spot for a new organization named the Live Brave Coalition, in partnership with the council, urging Americans to "simply live" and resume normal activities.
Because one characteristic American activity is shopping, the McCann office in Troy, Mich., produced the "Keep America Rolling" campaign for the General Motors Corporation, promoting zero percent financing on cars and trucks. That campaign is being credited with helping stimulate vehicle sales despite fears that uncertainty about the economy would keep consumers from buying big-ticket items.
Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, has also been busy in this realm, producing pro bono print ads ranging from an appeal for donations to organizations like the American Red Cross and the Heart of America Foundation to an effort to waive the term-limits law that prevented Mr. Giuliani for running for a third term. The agency also distributed pins created by the foundation, being sold in Hallmark stores to raise money for a Family Relief Fund.
But Saatchi & Saatchi came in for considerable ribbing back in its original headquarters city, London, for an e-mail message sent by Kevin Roberts, chief executive, on Sept. 12. The message described the agency's employees as "passionate, competitive and restless" and as "ideas people" who had "much to contribute" after the attacks, and concluded "Nothing is impossible."

HEADLINE: Loss Reported By Interpublic 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Interpublic Group of Companies said yesterday that it had lost $478 million in the third quarter as sales fell 7.4 percent after businesses cut back spending on marketing campaigns and rivals snatched away some accounts. 
 The loss came to $1.29 a share and was in contrast to a profit of $90.8 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. 
Sales fell to $1.61 billion from $1.73 billion. 
 A slowing economy compounded by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks reduced spending by Interpublic's customers, and it lost accounts like DaimlerChrysler, AT&T and PepsiCo Inc. The company, which is based in New York, expects fourth-quarter revenue to decline from year-earlier sales, although it was not more specific. 
Excluding restructuring and other costs, the company had profit of 15 cents a share. 
The loss of DaimlerChrysler cut $33.9 million from Interpublic's revenue, while the Sept. 11 attacks reduced sales by $35 million, the company said. 
So far this quarter, the company has gained new accounts including several additional assignments from Coca-Cola.

HEADLINE: After Hitler, Bin Laden Isn't So Scary; 
In Response to Terror, A New Generation Gap

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
Jess Biblowitz remains calm in the face of menace, uneasy about the stock market and the possibility of a military draft but not given to apocalyptic visions. Roy Kean feels swells of patriotism that send him browsing the "help wanted" page on the C.I.A. Web site. David Diggs plans to leave New York City, join his girlfriend in the Middle West and find a secure job in what has become an insecure economy.
 Mr. Biblowitz is 81, a World War II veteran. He says that people his age have little to lose in the current crisis, not enough energy for panic and a high threshold for adversity. Mr. Kean, 53, avoided the Vietnam War with a favorable lottery number. He says that people in their 40's and 50's already had the scare of a lifetime during the Cuban missile crisis. Mr. Diggs is 28 and knows nothing of war but plenty about prosperity. He says that his age group is reeling, their blithe assumptions buried in the World Trade Center rubble. 
 Three generations. Three reactions to a world suddenly gone awry. Each response, predictable but telling, is determined by crises already endured. And each plays out in ways both emotional and practical. 
There are exceptions to the patterns that emerged in two dozen interviews. But, over all, it seems fair to say that experience is a shock absorber; that historical perspective steadies the elderly and middle-aged, while those at the heady beginning of adulthood are upended by the events of Sept. 11.
"Each shock takes place in a long line of intermittent shocks," said Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology and journalism at New York University. Those who have "already had to manage dangers and disturbances and who have a life to fall back on" are more resilient, he said.
"If you have a history of circuit-jamming events, even if the shake-up is tremendous, the shock passes," Mr. Gitlin said. "Then you have the expectation, as we like to do in America, of moving on." 
Moving on is a comfortable concept for Mr. Biblowitz, who served in the Coast Guard in the North Atlantic, and his wife, Bunny, then a student at Brooklyn College, who sold war bonds, worked in the federal Office of Price Administration and bartered coupons for meat and nylon stockings. 
Both recall the ubiquity of the "war effort," a phrase on everyone's lips. "Doing without" was the norm, Mrs. Biblowitz said. Hailed as the greatest generation, men and women like the Biblowitzes went about their business in good times and bad. 
"Life went on," said Mrs. Biblowitz, 75. "Everybody coped with what had to be." 
Mr. Biblowitz concurred. "Death and tragedy become second nature," he said. "And at our age, we don't have as much to lose." Mr. Biblowitz said he had only two worries: his dwindling retirement reserves, given the state of the stock market, and his 17-year-old grandson, Eli, who is a year away from registering for the draft. 
At the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, several World War II veterans said they, too, had no fears for themselves but were uneasy for their children and grandchildren. Henry Lazar, 80, a mechanic in the Army Air Corps in England, is confident "life will go on and everyone will get over this." But Mr. Lazar, paralyzed on his left side from a stroke, wonders if his 22-year-old grandson, Jeremy, will face limited opportunities when he graduates from Fairleigh Dickinson University.
Isadore Haft, 94, agreed. "Nothing bothers me anymore," said Mr. Haft, who fought in the South Pacific and has a drawer full of photographs to show for it. But he fears the effect of a failing economy on his son-in-law, a vice president at Toys "R" Us. 
If the economy frightens the Vietnam-era generation, many with college tuitions to pay, it is not what dominates its conversation. Instead, reopening old rifts, they revisit their decisions about America's most unpopular war. They mull the meaning of flags flying from suburban homes, city high rises and S.U.V.'s. And they recall the civil defense drills and basement fallout shelters of the cold war and the memories of where they were when President John F. Kennedy, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated. 
Gerald Nagel, a public relations consultant, 57, said he was spared conscription by a "friendly draft board" and relieved of the scramble for deferments. Now, despite concerns about civil liberties and the protection of Israel, Mr. Nagel is gung-ho. 
He says that there is a "pent-up desire to be patriotic" in this age group, which has finally found its "enabling event, with the poles of good and evil clearly drawn." Being a patriot feels good, Mr. Nagel said, and is not diluted by fears of further terrorist attacks on American soil. 
He attributes this composure to the Cuban missile crisis, "the most scared I've been in my life or am likely to be." Mr. Nagel was a student at Bronx Community College in 1962 when Nikita Khruschev, the Soviet leader, pointed his bombs this way and young people were convinced "the world would come to an end by the end of the day." 
Then, as now, their elders seemed calmer. One student in Mr. Nagel's art appreciation class refused to complete an assignment, unwilling to waste his last hours on an unappealing task. The professor's blunt reply still echoes. "You may be right," Mr. Nagel recalls him saying. "But if Khrushchev and Kennedy work it out, the world will go on, the semester will continue and you will fail this course." 
For those who served in Vietnam, people like Mr. Nagel and Mr. Kean are "sunshine patriots, not winter soldiers." Rick Weidman, 55, the director of government relations for the Vietnam Veterans of America, says he is "ironically amused" to watch grown men, who know nothing of war, "reliving adolescent urges." 
Ron Powers, 63, who served in both Vietnam and Korea and now counsels veterans in Queens, is harsher. "I try to avoid them, grit my teeth and walk away," he said. "If I was 20 years younger, I'd punch them in the face." The day the towers fell, Mr. Powers -- whose son is a police officer raking the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island for human remains from the terror attack -- left his office shaking with rage and went home to watch John Wayne in the movie "The Searchers." If he were commander in chief, he said, "we'd have nuked them in hours, turned Afghanistan into a sand puddle." 
Memories of earlier calamities are what the people in their 20's are missing. While their personal lives were routinely disrupted by divorce, the world around them was a mostly placid place; war was a video game beamed into their living rooms from the Persian Gulf. And for those who graduated from college in the mid-1990's, jobs were there for the taking and six-figure salaries in certain professions the norm. 
"The sky was the limit," said Thomas Thibodeaux, 28, a trader. "There was always another job around the corner -- a bigger job, a better job, more money." 
No longer. Coreina Chan, 26, left an entry-level job in architecture to follow her boyfriend into stock trading. The goal was to make enough money to secure her future and her parents' and then return to the work she loved. "When we graduated," Ms. Chan said, "the biggest risk was to regret not living out your passion. Now it's not, 'Am I going to fulfill myself?' It's, 'How am I going to pay my bills?' " 
Looking our her window in Chinatown, which once framed a view of the World Trade Center, Ms. Chan inhales smoke. The neighborhood is still a tangle of police checkpoints and closed subway stations. She both lives and works downtown, as do many of her contemporaries. Even those who don't, come south to party. Or used to. 
It is no party these days in SoHo, where Katherine Rosman, 29, a freelance writer, picked at a muffin and spoke of her inability to absorb what has happened. "History is something you read about in books," she said. "It is not fun to be at the center of it."
Ms. Rosman is panicked in many ways: Struggling to focus on work, unable to tear herself from the television, reconsidering the safety of tall buildings. Her parents, like the president and the mayor, are begging her to get back to normal. 
"What's normal?" she asked. "Is the world ever going to be normal again? Is everything ever going to be O.K.?"

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
Restoring the Heart ofFord

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
In 1992, when Nicholas V. Scheele took the reins of the Ford Motor Company's recently acquired Jaguar luxury division, J. D. Power ranked the Jaguar's quality one notch above that of a Yugo.
 That's right, Yugo. The rickety car from the Balkans whose value doubled when you filled it with gas, according to one joke from the Yugo humor canon. 
 "Two magnificent European imports," Mr. Scheele, 57, Ford's new chief operating officer and president of automotive operations, wryly remarked in a recent interview. 
By the time Mr. Scheele left Jaguar in 1999, the cars' quality had improved so much that the insides of its vehicles closely matched their sleek skin and its sales were on the rebound, gilding Mr. Scheele's reputation as Ford's Mr. Fix-it.
Mr. Scheele (pronounced SHAY-lah) now has a new and far more ambitious charge: to turn around Ford itself, the nation's second-largest automaker behind General Motors. Put in charge of Ford of Europe in 1999, Mr. Scheele is well regarded inside and outside the company, but he is unproved at this scale.
"He works every front," said Ronald Tadross, an analyst for Bank of America. But now, Mr. Tadross added, "he's got a much bigger fish to fry."
Most analysts were convinced that Ford's broad management shake-up two weeks ago, which swept Jacques A. Nasser out as chief executive, was inevitable after the decline over the last year and a half of the company's reputation and financial fortunes. Attention has focused on William Clay Ford, Jr., the 44-year-old chairman and great-grandson of Henry Ford, who took over as chief executive, putting a member of the Ford family in charge of the company for the first time in two decades.
But it is the experienced Mr. Scheele who will have to lead Ford's troops into battle. Tapped in August to run Ford's North American operations, he was immediately put in charge of preparing a recovery plan for its automaking heart.
Wall Street, grown skeptical of unfulfilled promises, now waits to see the plan, due in January. More important, most analysts remain unsure whether Mr. Ford and Mr. Scheele will be able to carry it out effectively.
At Ford of Europe, Mr. Scheele improved the European product lineup while cutting capital spending and supplier costs. He also trimmed the hourly work force, which is concentrated in Britain and Germany, in part by using more common parts and processes. But his new assignment is still a big step up from the European unit, which accounts for only about a quarter of the cars sold by Ford worldwide, to making substantial change at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.
Mr. Scheele and Mr. Ford have preached a "back to basics" approach that hews to improving the business instead of redefining it, as Mr. Nasser originally sought. There have already been numerous cuts -- slashing the dividend in half, reducing the white-collar work force by 5,000 workers, cutting production and idling some plants -- yet more are clearly inevitable.
The fall of Ford came quickly. Only a year ago, Mr. Nasser was considered a hard-charging, innovative executive who styled himself after John F. Welch Jr., the recently retired chairman of General Electric. Then came the bruising dispute with Bridgestone/Firestone over what part tires played in fatal rollovers of the Ford Explorer. Dealers, meanwhile, rebelled at Mr. Nasser's plans to build dealerships directly and sell cars online. Managers chafed at a strict new grading system. And Ford fell behind G.M. and Chrysler in quality rankings.
"Go back to last year this time, Ford was the premium company out of the three," said Kevin Rendino, manager of the $8.6 billion Merrill Lynch Basic Value fund, which has reduced its holdings of Ford stock by 70 percent since the middle of 2000.
"Now," he said, "it's almost flip-flopped and Ford has the worst reputation."
Support from other professional investors has wavered as well. Invesco, the Denver fund group, held almost two million shares at the end of September, according to S.E.C. filings, but has since sold all of its shares, a spokeswoman said. Janus Capital, one of the nation's largest fund companies, sold all of its 8.1 million shares of Ford Motor in the second quarter.
Such is the climate Mr. Scheele faces. He joined the company in 1966 after his grades at Durham University in England were not high enough to get him into the British foreign service. He selected Ford over I.B.M. and other companies, he says, because he was low on money and Ford wanted him to start immediately.
"I didn't do any work in college," he said. "I played a lot of sports. I played a lot of cards. I drank a lot, basically, because I wasn't interested."
At Ford, he found a place where he was "actually doing something that contributed from Day 1; that was a huge motivator." 
Mr. Scheele came up through the purchasing department, an unusual path for a top executive, but one that gave him a feel for cost-cutting. But he had to do far more than hack at waste at Jaguar, which by the early 1990's was little more than a famed brand name with a waning reputation. Jaguar's sales were at a low and Toyota's Lexus group was stealing customers. Jaguar's sedan had been around since the early 80's and its sports car since the early 70's.
"They were old and tired and very expensive," Mr. Scheele said. "There was nothing in the pipeline."
Mr. Scheele first reassured wary dealers by flying them to England to show them his new product plans, and by introducing a more generous leasing deal. Then, he sought to invigorate the work force by assuring them that the company was not about to go under and by fostering an emotional connection between its customers and its workers, whose job it was to make cars that most of them could not afford.
Instead of cutting pay, as expected, he won concessions that stripped out two layers of bureaucracy and gave the company greater control over the selection of work-group leaders. But the most innovative action was to have some of Jaguar's hourly workers make phone calls to customers who reported problems.
"Bear in mind, these are line operators who would never have the economic capability of affording the cars," Mr. Scheele said. "They're now talking to customers that, in economic terms, are hugely differentiated.
"The power of using the line operator, the hourly guy, to talk to a customer, you cannot believe it," he said. "It provided a direct link, the communication was there, and they could see it through the customer's eyes."
Since Jaguar's financial results are not broken out in Ford Motor's financial statements, it is difficult to pinpoint its actual performance, except to say it was losing money when Mr. Scheele came in and making money when he left.
At Ford of Europe, he began extensive cost-cutting efforts, like using more common parts in making different cars like Jaguars or Lincolns, that analysts now expect will be brought to North America. Mr. Tadross, like many other analysts, says the company needs to cut North American costs by $5 billion over the next two to three years, about 5 percent of sales over that period. That will probably require closing up to five plants to reduce production, eliminating about 10,000 hourly workers out of 100,000 and cutting about 6,000 white-collar workers from a staff of 45,000.
Such turnaround plans come along every few years at one auto company or another. The Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, unveiled its own turnaround effort in February. The challenge from Wall Street's perspective is actually getting the plan to work.
One of the biggest hurdles Ford must overcome is persuading the United Automobile Workers to agree to close plants, because Big Three labor contracts forbid closings without union consent.
The change of management may help. The knock against Mr. Nasser was not his ideas, many of which were considered innovative, but his approach. While top management and the public were consumed by the Firestone dispute, relations were fraying with dealers, suppliers, white-collar workers and the union. Mr. Scheele's skills in dealing with such constituencies are better regarded.
Indeed, Mr. Scheele says the most interesting part of the business to him is relationships. "Above all, the fascination is the people, be they employees, dealers, suppliers, whatever," he said. "Communications are absolutely critical. You've got to have a mutual understanding of what everybody's objectives are because life ain't a bed of roses and we should debate and discuss."
And that may be Mr. Scheele's greatest advantage in the months ahead. "He doesn't put on airs," said Jerry Reynolds, a Ford dealer in Garland, Tex. who is a former chairman of the Ford National Dealer Council. Mr. Reynolds recalled a dealer convention earlier this year where Mr. Nasser and Mr. Scheele appeared together. 
"Nasser came out in a $1,000 suit and tie and stood stiffly," he said. "I don't think he was ever comfortable with the dealers. Nick came out in a short-sleeve shirt, no tie, looked a little rumpled. He said, 'I want to tell you how sorry I am about the things we've done.' Talk about music to your ears."

HEADLINE: Russia Seeks Belated Peace Dividend 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The people who run Russia's companies and oversee its economy did not draft a formal wish list of economic measures for President Vladimir V. Putin to raise with George Bush as they meet this week. That is because what they want from the United States can be boiled down to one point: stop treating Russia like an enemy economy. 
 As Russia moves to integrate its economy with the rest of the world's, business leaders and government officials here say that more support is needed from America to smooth the way. American officials say that they are doing what they can, but that they cannot move faster than Congress and other countries' governments will allow. 
 "Russia wants to become a part of the international community and global economy," said Alexei Mordashov, general director of Severstal, one of Russia's biggest steel plants. "It would be right for all Western countries -- the U.S. and Europe -- not to push us away, but to help us in this process."
In the tumult of the first decade after Communism, Russian economic relations with the West mainly took the form of emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund. Now that Russia's economy has three steady years of growth under its belt and investment is beginning to flow on a large scale, more normal relations are possible, and Russian companies are eager to gain greater access to Western markets.
But laws and regulations unchanged since cold war days stand in the way, officials and businesses here say, especially in the United States.
"There are some remnants, some heritage from the past that should be corrected," said Andrei Illarionov, Mr. Putin's economic adviser, in an interview last week. "Russia should be considered an equal partner. We cannot be equal by economic size, demographics, or geographical location. But in commercial relations, in all these rules of behavior, it should be very normal good relations among neighbors."
One problem area is Russia's status under American antidumping laws, which are meant to protect American industries from unfair competition. The laws penalize countries that are deemed to have tried to increase their market share in the United States by selling goods below the cost of production.
In antidumping suits, which hinge upon production costs, Russia is treated as a "nonmarket" economy. For purposes of calculating production costs, the law calls for a "surrogate" market-economy country to be used for comparisons with the United States. But such countries often have little in common with Russia, and as one Western embassy's trade issues specialist acknowledged, the practice is "usually disadvantageous to the party charged with dumping."
The Russian government has applied to the Commerce Department to change its status and begin using actual cost figures from Russia, rather than from any surrogate, in antidumping calculations.
Russia's steel industry has suffered since 1998, when the United States accused it of dumping hot- rolled steel, its main export. At the time, the Russian government agreed to accept quotas to avoid punitive duties. Since then, Severstal's exports to the United States have fallen by three-quarters. 
Another roadblock is the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a 1974 sanction intended to press Communist-bloc nations to permit free emigration, particularly of Jews, from the Soviet Union.
The law has not been invoked against Russia in years, but the fact that it remains on the books would block Russia from obtaining trade privileges from the United States once Russia joins the World Trade Organization. Other former Soviet republics, like Georgia, which has already joined the trade organization, are similarly restricted by the law. 
The Bush administration has asked Congress to scrap the Jackson-Vanik law. When that might happen is unclear, but its repeal is not expected to be controversial.
Russia wants to join the World Trade Organization as soon as it can, both to gain easier access to foreign markets and to gain the tools to defend its manufactured products there. Half of Russia's exports today are basic commodities -- chiefly oil and gas -- that need no protection. But goods like steel and fertilizer now face restrictions on imports to the United States that Russians say are unfair; as long as Russia is outside the W.T.O., it has no avenue to appeal them.
Membership "is the most important issue for us," said Alexei Kudrin, Russia's finance minister, in an interview last month.
Even with American support, Russia still faces arduous negotiations over membership. China's recently completed membership talks started in the 1980's. But Washington can help grease the skids. 
Above all, Russia wants more private investment by American companies. A recent tax ruling opened the way for a consortium led by Exxon Mobil to start on a $12 billion oil and gas development in Russia's Far East. More such projects could bind Russia more closely to the United States, businesses argue.
"Russia can be a very useful part of the world, economically and politically," Mr. Mordashev said. "This is a chance for getting closer, for getting more Russian goods into the American market and more American goods into the Russian market. This is a chance for more integration."
And Russia is now a better place to invest than it was in the early 1990's, companies say.
"In 1991 there was nothing -- just euphoria," said Anatoly Karachinsky, founder and chief executive of IBS, a Russian computer services conglomerate. "When the East saw how the West lived, we thought that soon we would be able to live like that. But then it turned out we had to build an economy. And we have been building it. It wasn't all successes, but we've made the first steps -- the foundation."
Ultimately, investors will want to see more than warm words between governments before they open businesses here. A stable government, a reasonable tax system and a legal system that protects property rights are essential prerequisites, and Russia is still in the process of putting them in place.
"Our decisions about investing in Russia are made on the merits of how we see the market developing," said John Stevenson, president of Frito-Lay's operations in Central and Eastern Europe. Frito, a unit of PepsiCo, said last month that it would build a $40 million snack food factory in Russia. "There isn't very much of a connection between the events of September and the decision to invest."

HEADLINE: 10 Nations Look Like Prospects For Joining the European Union 

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The European Union announced today that as many as 10 countries from Southern and Central Europe may be allowed to join by 2004. 
 Across the region, post-Communist states welcomed what they saw as a vote of confidence from the European Commission, the union's administrative arm, and a sign that their painful economic reforms would soon bring them membership in the exclusive club of Europe's richest nations. 
 Reports issued today on membership negotiations with candidates praised eight Central European and Baltic countries -- the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia -- as well as Malta and Cyprus. All got high marks for economic and democratic reforms. 
Gunther Verheugen, the union's commissioner for enlargement, said the first new members could join the 15-member body before elections to the European Parliament in June 2004. "It is not a utopian dream," Mr. Verheugen said today in a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. "It is a realistic and feasible challenge."
The commission's president, Romano Prodi, said that after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the European Union must expand its "area of stability and prosperity." 
"A historic moment really is just around the corner if we are able to keep up the pace," of reform in the candidate countries, Mr. Prodi said.
The reports issued today still had harsh words for many candidates. They warned that candidate countries must tackle corruption, bureaucracy and a lingering reluctance by parliaments and administrations to put into operation the laws and rules already in place inside the European Union. 
Trafficking in women and children and the treatment of Gypsies were also singled out as problems that should be addressed by the applicant countries.
Turkey, criticized over economic problems and human rights abuses, lashed out at the reports.
"It has become clearer that concepts and status constantly invented for Turkey are nothing but delaying tactics," said Deputy Prime Minister Devlet Bahceli. He said the European Union's attitude toward Turkey was "biased and ill-intentioned."
Bulgaria and Romania were given failing marks by the European Union, which said they had yet to develop functioning market economies.
Several politically sensitive issues still have to be resolved, including whether there will be free movement of workers from the new countries in the existing member states, how European Union subsidies would be extended to new members and plans for agricultural reform in the poorer candidate countries.

HEADLINE: German Leader Calls Vote of Confidence on Role in Afghanistan 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Putting severe pressure on his junior coalition partner, the Greens, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder today called a parliamentary vote of confidence over his decision to deploy up to 3,900 troops to support the war in Afghanistan.
 The vote, called for Friday, could result in a new ruling coalition in Germany or even new elections, a year before they are scheduled. Whatever happens, the politically adroit Mr. Schroder is likely to remain chancellor. 
 Mr. Schroder has made much of solidarity with the United States since Sept. 11, and what he terms the historic move to deploy German troops outside Europe for the first time since 1945. He told members of his Social Democratic Party that he intended the vote to force the Greens, who have their roots in pacifism and opposition to the Vietnam War, to renew their commitment to the coalition and the requirements of power. 
Late this afternoon Mr. Schroder spoke directly to Green lawmakers to make his case.
Tonight, in a brief statement televised live, he said that he would win the vote, but that more work was required. "It will require more discussion and more convincing, but I think that everyone knows the special significance of what is at stake here," he said. 
Mr. Schroder has staked his reputation on shaping a Germany that will take its proper place, militarily as well as economically, in Europe and the Atlantic alliance.
But the Greens are ambivalent at best. Seven Green legislators -- and some members of Mr. Schroder's own Social Democratic Party -- have said they will vote against the deployment, arguing that the war in Afghanistan is not the way to defeat terrorism and is causing too much harm to civilians.
Parliament must ratify any deployment of German troops outside Germany. That vote will now be considered a vote of confidence and should take place on Friday, said Peter Struck, the Social Democrats' leader in Parliament.
Mr. Schroder has the support of his Green foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, and most other Green party leaders. But ordinary Greens are unhappy with the compromises the party has made to retain power.
If he loses Friday's vote, Mr. Schroder could form a new coalition with the liberal Free Democrats, add them to the current coalition or even try to form a broader unity government with the conservative Christian Democrats. Or he could seek new elections.
With the economy in recession and unemployment rising toward 4 million -- Mr. Schroder had promised to get it under 3.5 million -- early elections that focus on Germany's role in the world, and not domestic doldrums, could be a way for Mr. Schroder to secure a new mandate and remake the government.
"Schroder is linking the vote of confidence to the vote on the military because if he lets the disagreement within the coalition pass, he will have to worry about this happening again," said Oskar Niedermayer, a professor of politics at the Free University, Berlin. "He must ensure that he can trust in his coalition."
Laurenz Meyer, of the opposition Christian Democrats, expects the coalition to survive. "The Greens are glued to their jobs," he said sarcastically. "They would rather drive the tanks themselves than give up their ministry posts."
New elections would not favor the conservatives. They are in the middle of a leadership battle, with the party chairwoman, Angela Merkel, considered a sure loser in any election against Mr. Schroder.

Other People's Money

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
You may have seen the story about the businessman who allegedly used the attack on the World Trade Center to make off with other people's money. According to his accusers, Andrei Koudachev stole $105 million that had been invested with his firm, falsely asserting that the sum had been lost in the collapse of the towers. It's not entirely clear whether he is accused of stealing the money before Sept. 11, then using the disaster to cover his tracks, or of taking the money after the fact; maybe both.
 It's too bad that so many of our leaders are trying to pull the same trick. 
 Just before Sept. 11, political debate was dominated by the growing evidence that last spring's tax cut was not, in fact, consistent with George W. Bush's pledge not to raid the projected $2.7 trillion Social Security surplus. After the attack, everyone dropped the subject. At this point, it seems that nobody will complain as long as the budget as a whole doesn't go into persistent deficit.
But two months into the war on terrorism, we're starting to get a sense of how little this war will actually cost. And it's time to start asking some hard questions.
At the beginning of the week we learned that the war is currently costing around $1 billion per month. Oddly, this was reported as if it were a lot of money. But it's only about half of 1 percent of the federal budget. In monetary terms, not only doesn't this look like World War II, it looks trivial compared with the gulf war. No mystery there; how hard is it for a superpower to tip the balance in the civil war of a small, poor nation? At this rate, even five years of war on terrorism would cost only $60 billion.
True, the terrorist attack has also forced increased spending at home. But Mr. Bush has threatened to veto any spending on domestic security beyond the $40 billion already agreed. And even that sum is in doubt. Half of the $40 billion was money promised to New York; last week New York's Congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats alike, demanded that Mr. Bush disburse the full sum, openly voicing doubt about whether he would honor his promise.
So the budgetary cost of the war on terrorism, abroad and at home, looks like fairly small change. Even counting the measures that are likely to pass despite Mr. Bush's threat, I have a hard time coming up with a total cost that exceeds $200 billion. Compare that with the $2.7 trillion Social Security surplus. What will happen to the remaining $2.5 trillion?
Again, no mystery: much of the money was actually gone before Sept. 11, swallowed by last spring's tax cut, which will in the end reduce revenue by around $1 trillion more than the numbers you usually hear. And the administration's allies in Congress are striving energetically to give away the rest in tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy individuals.
The new round of tax cuts is supposedly intended as post-terror economic stimulus. But recent remarks by Dick Armey give the game away. Defending the bill he and Tom DeLay rammed through the House -- the one that gives huge retroactive tax cuts to big corporations -- he asserted that it would create 170,000 jobs next year. That would add a whopping 0.13 percent to employment in this country. So thanks to Mr. Armey's efforts next year's unemployment rate might be 6.4 percent instead of 6.5. Aren't you thrilled? 
Let's do the math here. This bill has a $100 billion price tag in its first year, more than $200 billion over three years. So even on Mr. Armey's self-justifying estimate, we're talking about giving at least $600,000 in corporate tax breaks for every job created. That's trickle-down economics without the trickle-down. 
Ten weeks ago this bill, or the equally bad bill proposed by Senate Republicans, wouldn't have stood a chance. But now people who want to give the Social Security surplus to campaign donors think they can get away with it, because they can blame Osama bin Laden for future budget shortfalls.
They say every cloud has a silver lining. The dust cloud that rose when the towers fell has certainly helped politicians who don't want you to see what they're up to.

President Bush ordered the Energy Department today to increase the United States' emergency supply of oil, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to its capacity over the next few years, the first time it will be full.
 Filling the oil reserve to capacity "will strengthen the long-term energy security of the United States," Mr. Bush said in a statement. 
 Analysts have said that strengthening the United States' insurance against a break in the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf region gained urgency when the strikes on Afghanistan began. But Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham denied that the president's decision was influenced by the heightened tension. 
Created in 1975, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a network of underground caverns in Louisiana and Texas, was intended to smooth out, in the short run, the price spikes and possible shortages that could be caused by a disruption in supplies. It has a capacity of 700 million barrels of oil and now contains about 545 million barrels, which at the country's current rate of imports would last 53 days if foreign supplies were halted. The most the oil reserve has ever contained was about 590 million barrels in the early 1990's, which at the time would have been enough for 82 days if there were no imports. 
The United States imports a smaller percentage of its oil from the Middle East than it did 30 years ago, and would not be paralyzed by oil shortages if supplies from the region fell considerably. But the broad economy, and the individual consumer, would encounter sharply higher prices as supplies dwindled. Despite the reduced reliance on oil from the Persian Gulf, the country consumes and imports far more oil over all than it did a decade ago, exacerbating the vulnerability of the economy to a precipitous drop in supplies. 
The White House announcement comes on the eve of a meeting by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries here on Wednesday. OPEC, facing falling prices, is expected to reduce output by a million to 1.5 million barrels a day. 
Analysts in Vienna, Washington and New York were divided over whether the White House's announcement was meant to sway OPEC's decision.
Some said the timing was a coincidence. But others thought that the White House might want OPEC to factor into its forecasts that filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would require, on average, an extra 100,000 barrels of oil a day for about two years. The move might also be viewed by OPEC, some experts said, as an effort by the White House to help stabilize oil markets by bolstering demand, if only by a relatively small part of worldwide use -- now estimated a little above 76 million barrels a day.
"It goes to underscore the notion that there are common interests between the United States and a country like Saudi Arabia on oil prices," said Jan Stuart, head of research on global energy futures at ABN Amro. "They don't want prices too high or too low. Very low prices would hurt the oil industry in the United States, an important industry here, and it would be damaging to parts of the world we care about like Venezuela, the Middle East and Indonesia."
Crude oil prices rose on the announcement. In New York, crude oil for December delivery climbed 44 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $21.67 a barrel. Brent crude oil for December delivery also rose 2.1 percent in London.
Mr. Bush has been considering ways to fill the strategic reserve for at least three weeks, industry experts said. The reserve could have been filled rapidly if the White House had asked Congress to appropriate money to buy oil on the open market. But with many industries and constituencies competing for federal money, the chances of an appropriation were considered slim.
Instead, the Energy Department will take oil rather than cash royalty payments from companies that lease federal lands for drilling. The quantities will be small at first, the Interior Department said, because there are still contracts in force between the government and the companies for cash payments. But once many of those contracts expire in late March, the in-kind oil payments should start in greater amounts.
The plan will add 108 million barrels of oil to the reserve on top of an increase of 48 million barrels already expected by 2003, much of it as the payment for a deal last year under which oil companies received crude oil from the government to be refined into heating fuel. At current prices, the 108 million barrels would be valued around $2.3 billion.
Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, referring to the time needed to fill the reserve through the in-kind payment plan, said: "It will take two and a half years or more to get a job done that should have been done in the next six months. But to avoid an appropriations battle, the White House took the line of least political resistance."
The Bush administration's move comes as the Saudi Arabian oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, the de facto leader of OPEC, completed a quick tour of major non-OPEC exporters, including Russia and Norway, to coax them to hold output at current levels or decrease it in an effort to shore up prices.
So far, he has had little success. Russia agreed to reduce exports by only 30,000 barrels a day, at a time when its exports would have declined slightly anyway because of increased heating oil use at home. Norway rebuffed Mr. Naimi's entreaties. Oman, a small producer, has said that it will decrease exports. And it is uncertain what Mexico, a principal exporter to the United States, will do.

HEADLINE: Start of Recession Thought to Be in March 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The six economists who determine when recessions officially begin and end have publicly mentioned March for the first time as the month in which the longest economic expansion in American history "possibly" ended and the current recession "possibly" began.
 March 2001 appeared yesterday in a memo signed by the six economists and posted on the Web site of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization in Cambridge, Mass., that has gained over the years the final say in dating business cycles. 
 "I would not be surprised to see March chosen as the peak month of the last expansion and thus that makes March the first month of the ongoing recession," said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist and a member of the Bureau's Business Cycle Dating Committee.
Until now, the committee had not publicly mentioned a possible starting date for the recession. 
The decision will probably come very soon, Mr. Gordon added in a telephone interview, either at a formal committee meeting, the traditional method, or through e-mail exchanges. A formal meeting has not been scheduled, but e-mail messages are going back and forth at a considerable pace.
Mr. Gordon and Robert Hall, a Stanford University economist and the committee chairman, were described by another committee member as the most convinced that March was the turning point. They are the senior members and their view carries a lot of weight. Some other members, however, are less certain. Ben Bernanke, a Princeton University economist, is one.
"It is a very difficult call," Mr. Bernanke said, "because the indicators are not as synchronized as they usually are."
The popular definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of contraction in the gross domestic product, a proxy for the entire economy. The committee, however, tracks more detailed measures and sometimes waits a year or more beyond what seems to be the turning point in the business cycle to be sure that an expansion or a contraction does not peter out.
This time, the terrorist attacks strengthened the view that March was the start of the 10th recession since World War II. "We are now about two months after Sept. 11," Mr. Gordon said, "and I do not think that we would be talking so soon about dating the start of a recession if it had not been for the extra downward push to the economy from Sept. 11."
If last March becomes the official date, then the expansion that started in March 1991 will have ended on its 10th birthday. The average length of the nine previous recessions since World War II was 11 months. If the current downturn is of average length, it would end in February. The two longest recessions -- in the mid-1970's and early 1980's -- each lasted 16 months.
The Business Cycle Dating Committee takes the gross domestic product into account, but since G.D.P. is continually revised, often decades later, the committee relies much more on four other national gauges: industrial production, employment, inflation-adjusted personal income and wholesale-retail trade.
Three of the four indicators have behaved in the last few months as they behaved in the early months of previous recessions, the committee said in its latest monthly progress report, which was posted on the Internet yesterday. The fourth, personal income, had not peaked in September, although it probably has now, Mr. Gordon said.
The starting date is a hard call this time. Usually, the committee's favored indicators turn down together, but this time industrial production peaked in September of last year, wholesale and retail trade during the winter, employment last March and personal income probably in October. The March date represents a blending, according to committee members.
"We could end up deciding tentatively among ourselves on the date for the peak," said Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, "and yet wait six months to officially announce it."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: NORTHERN ALLIANCE; 
Despite Flowers and Festivities, Alliance Finds an Uneasy Capital

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
On trucks, tanks and armored troop carriers, Northern Alliance forces poured into this battered capital today, greeted initially by flowers and festivities but confronting a situation of explosive uncertainty. 
 Defying American requests that they stay out of Kabul, alliance units occupied the city and tacked their green, white and black flags to ministry gates. Music played and men shaved beards in celebration of release from the Taliban's rule. 
 One man, standing outside an abandoned office of the Taliban religious police, held up one of the whips used to strike women who did not wear veils. He led the crowd in a chant of "Death to Mullah Omar!" -- a reference to the reclusive Taliban leader. 
But an uneasy mood gripped Kabul as nightfall came and even this morning, the potential for chaos was clear.
After alliance soldiers killed six Arabs and Pakistanis who tried to ambush them, including two who fired from a tree, dozens of residents set upon the bodies, bludgeoning them with stones and spitting on them. 
One young man repeatedly stabbed a corpse in the chest with a knife and then jammed it into the dead man's eye. The International Committee of the Red Cross removed the bodies before nightfall. 
To many Afghans, foreign fighters like these Arabs and Pakistanis are particularly hated symbols of the Taliban and the radical brand of Islam they imposed on Afghanistan after taking power five years ago. 
Taliban forces retreated to positions south of Kabul near the town of Chahar Asiab, pursued by Northern Alliance soldiers and the American warplanes that have pummeled them over the past six weeks. Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taliban leader whose whereabouts are now unknown, urged his scattered troops to fight on.
"Any person who goes hither and thither is like a slaughtered chicken that falls and dies," Mullah Omar said in a radio address. "You should regroup yourselves, resist and fight." He did not refer to his guest, the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden, whose whereabouts remain unclear. 
In the north, cornered in the city of Kunduz, the Taliban did resist today, repulsing a Northern Alliance attack. In the south, where the Taliban stronghold is the city of Kandahar, there were reports of moderate forces abandoning the hard-line faction of Mullah Omar, but these reports could not be confirmed. 
At a press conference tonight, Abdullah Abdullah, the designated foreign minister of the Northern Alliance, said there was an uprising against the Taliban in the eastern city of Jalalabad, on the main road from here to the Pakistani border. It was impossible to confirm this claim. 
He also defended the alliance's decision to take Kabul, saying that the departure of the Taliban left a vacuum that had to be filled. "There were security problems for the people of Kabul to which the alliance had to respond," he said.
That the Taliban fled Kabul in haste seemed clear. A machine gun and three mortar rounds that had been set up to defend the presidency building were still in place today.
Whether the Taliban is now capable of regrouping and forming an effective guerrilla force was one of many unanswered questions provoked by the abrupt -- and apparently unscripted -- transformation today of this American-led war.
Another central question was glaringly apparent in this city as anxiety grew during the day: how will the mainly ethnic Pashtun population be treated by alliance forces composed mostly of Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras from the north? 
The potential for violence seemed great, despite urgent American pleas for restraint. Across town, groups of young men with stolen guns and crude muskets declared themselves policeman and occupied the presidency building.
They set upon one boy accused of stealing, shoving and slapping him. As dozens of people watched this morning, they dragged him into a guard shed. Hafizullah, a banker who was in the crowd, pleaded for order.
"There is a vacuum of power," he said. "My message to the United States and the United Nations is that they must decide about the security of Kabul very soon. All of the people are afraid of this situation."
The United States, and its main regional ally in the war, Pakistan, had warned that the Northern Alliance should remain outside the city. But they never clarified how they proposed to restrain a victorious, advancing northern army, and in the end momentum mattered more than any pleas to halt.
Pakistan, with a large Pashtun population and a rival, India, to the east, is determined to prevent a hostile Northern Alliance government from taking power in Kabul.
But the situation on the ground has run far ahead of the political planning, with proposals for some sort of temporary United Nations administration buttressed by an international force still vague. In this vacuum, mayhem appears to be a likely outcome. 
Capt. Muhammad Akbar and his 10 men from the Northern Alliance tried today to reassure people. They stood around a bustling traffic circle here tonight and attempted to demonstrate that law and order would prevail.
Hours after crowds showered them with flowers and money as they entered the city, the officer and his soldiers began operating a checkpoint to look for goods and weapons stolen from Taliban bases.
While some Kabul residents greeted the captain and his men with open arms, other barely spoke to them. 
The captain and all of his men are ethnic Tajiks, while the majority of the people in Afghanistan are ethnic Pashtuns, with clear memories of the corruption, chaos and civil war that engulfed the city when the alliance leaders last tried to run it six years ago. 
Murad Mohd, an unemployed 36-year-old man, echoed other exhausted city residents when asked what the city needed most. "First, the security is most important," he said. "After that, they should improve the situation in Afghanistan. Many of the people are poor."
Asked which leader could best achieve those goals, he returned again to security. "We just need the one who wants peace and stability in the country," he said. "We just want that one."
As many as 6,000 alliance troops entered the city this morning, but most of them continued southward in pursuit of the Taliban, leaving special police units at checkpoints and crucial positions in this city where perhaps one million people still eke out a living. As the day wore on, these police units established order, searching cars and patrolling the streets.
Several people took out cassette recorders and played music for the first time in years. Barbers did a brisk business shaving beards. "Now, I have permission to control my beard," said Abdel Rahman, a clean-shaven 20-year-old who said he shaved his beard off today. 
Asked if women liked his new look, he grinned and said "Yes, they like it."
Residents generally expressed warmth, not hostility, toward the United States. When an American warplane flew overhead, a boy said he did not fear it. "They are chasing them now," he said, referring to Taliban who fled southward from the city.
Women did not remove the long, all-concealing robes known as burkas -- they are the traditional attire of Afghanistan -- but a few did briefly expose their faces, an act that risked a public whipping under Taliban rule. 
Food appeared plentiful. A central market that lines the road leading into the city had large amounts of fresh meat for sale, fruit juices from Iran and even Coca-Cola, a testament to the strength of smuggling networks in the area.
As night fell, lights came on in the city for the first time in weeks. Under Taliban orders, the lights had been extinguished to protect Kabul from American bombing.
That bombing appears, in general, to have hit its targets -- military bases and government complexes within walled compounds. There was little visible evidence today on city streets of buildings damaged by American bombing.

HEADLINE: THE BUSH-PUTIN SUMMIT: MILITARY ANALYSIS; 
U.S. Arsenal: Treaties vs. Nontreaties

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush did not mention it, but the arms control approach he presented today would undo one of the signal accomplishments of his father's administration: the ban on multiple-warhead missiles based on land. 
 Throughout the cold war, it was widely assumed that such missiles were particularly destabilizing weapons. NATO was so worried about the Soviet Union's 10-warhead SS-18 that its code name for the missile was Satan, and Reagan administration hard-liners warned darkly that it would be useful for a surprise strike. 
 Start II, a treaty signed in 1993 by the first Bush administration, banned land-based Mirvs, as the multiple-warhead missiles are known, a move that arms control specialists agreed made the nuclear balance more stable. 
But the new Bush administration does not see Russia as a nuclear adversary and, officials say, has no interest in rescuing Start II, which has never taken effect because of disputes about conditions attached by both the United States Congress and the Russian parliament.
By omitting any mention of Start II, the administration signaled that its strategy is to leapfrog over that agreement and move to a more streamlined arrangement in which the United States and Russia separately announce plans for deep cuts. 
That means that Start II and its provisions, including the ban on land-based missiles with multiple warheads, becomes an artifact of history, one policymaker said.
Administration officials say there is no need to perpetuate a ban hammered out during the tense days of the cold war. Much of the new American deterrent will be based on submarines, making it almost invulnerable to surprise attack.
But some arms control proponents are critical.
"It means abandoning one of the most hard fought gains for U.S. national security," said Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "Multiple warhead missiles are dangerous weapons and will remain in the Russian arsenal long after Putin is gone."
The new administration stance is part of a broad rethinking about arms control that has led the administration to announce reductions in its nuclear arsenal. 
In considering how deeply to cut America's nuclear arsenal, President Bush faced a quandary. 
The Russians, whose own nuclear force is shrinking by the day because of economic pressures, wanted the United States to reduce the number of warheads to 1,500. But the United States Strategic Command, which oversees American nuclear forces, had been actively resisting such a deep cut, hoping to keep the level at around 2,250 warheads.
Today, Mr. Bush gave them both what they were looking for.
With President Vladimir V. Putin by his side, Mr. Bush announced that the United States would cut the number of its warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 over 10 years, from the current level of more than 6,000.
When Mr. Bush took office, he called for a fresh look at the United States' nuclear posture, taking full account of the end of the cold war competition with the Soviets. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld began a review of the country's nuclear requirements. 
Still, there was no consensus on how deep the nuclear cuts should go, particularly because of the hawkish views of Adm. Richard W. Mies, the commander of the Strategic Command, who also resisted the push for deep cuts during the Clinton administration.
While Bush administration officials insist that their review was driven by a hard-headed look at nuclear requirements, no one was oblivious to the foreign policy implications.
A public pledge to slash the number of nuclear arms, officials understood, would help make the case to the Russians, as well as to other Europeans, that the administration's plan to build a missile defense was not part of a drive for strategic dominance. 
It might even make the Russians more willing to go along with the administration's plans to conduct antimissile tests. These were not permitted by the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, an accord that is still a bone of contention.
The results of this American promise to cut the arsenal to 1,700 to 2,200 warheads over the next decade are significant. It would bring about a two-thirds reduction in the current arsenal. It is also an important advance over Start II, which called for reductions to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads. 
"The Bush team are on a positive trend line for the first time toward moving below 2,000 warheads," said Rose Gottemoeller, a senior Energy Department official from the Clinton administration.
Still, the cuts were not as deep as some arms control advocates would have liked. They are only a little lower than the goals President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin set in 1997 -- 2,000 to 2,500 warheads each. (The Pentagon assumed that American warheads would be on the high end of that range and Russian warheads would be on the low end.) 
In outlining the cuts today, the administration also changed how nuclear weapons are counted, excluding those on submarines and bombers that are being overahuled. This will reduce the count by several hundred weapons without actually eliminating them.
Still, some of the most important shifts had nothing to do with numbers. In addition to quietly walking away from Start II's ban on land-based multiple warhead missiles, the Bush administration says there is no need for formal treaties on offensive nuclear arms. 
Instead, the administration's approach is to spell out the reductions the United States is planning while the Russians do the same. The reductions would be verified by provisions for on-site monitoring carried over from Start I, signed in 1991.
Administration officials say that dispensing with treaties will enable them to avoid the lengthy process it takes to negotiate them. But critics say it will also leave the two sides without a solid legal undertaking on nuclear arms that would outlast the Bush and Putin administrations.
Mr. Putin was skeptical as well, saying he was prepared to codify all of the understandings between the United States and the Russians "in treaty form." 
Mr. Bush signaled that he did not think that a formal treaty was necessary, but added he would be willing to make a less formal commitment. 
"If we need to write it down on piece of paper," he said, "I'd be glad to do that."

President Bush and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin pledged to cut their nuclear stockpiles by roughly two-thirds over the next decade, leaving each side with fewer than 2,200 warheads. But the two countries still seemed far apart on missile defenses, with Mr. Putin resisting American efforts for a quick agreement that would allow Mr. Bush to conduct tests currently in violation of the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty.

HEADLINE: THE BUSH-PUTIN SUMMIT: THE ACCORD; 
Bush and Putin Agree to Reduce Stockpile of Nuclear Warheads

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia pledged today to cut their nuclear stockpiles by roughly two-thirds over the next decade, leaving each side with fewer than 2,200 warheads.
 But the two nations still seemed far apart on missile defenses, with Mr. Putin resisting American efforts for a quick agreement that would allow Mr. Bush to conduct tests that would violate the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty. 
 At the start of three days of meetings in Washington and Crawford, Tex., Mr. Bush told Mr. Putin today that the United States would unilaterally reduce its nuclear arsenal to 1,700 to 2,200 warheads. 
While he did not immediately respond to Mr. Bush's announcement, Mr. Putin stressed in a speech tonight at the Russian Embassy that he, too, planned deep cuts.
"Russia declares and reiterates its readiness to make considerable reductions in strategic arms," he said. "We propose a radical program of further reductions of strategic offensive arms by at least three times, to a minimal level necessary for maintaining strategic balance in the world. We no longer have to intimidate each other to reach agreements."
The cuts suggested by each side, while not in any formal agreement, appeared to mark a milestone in strategic relations between the two countries, swiftly achieving deep weapons cuts that used to take years to negotiate.
Russia's current arsenal contains about 5,800 warheads; the reduction Mr. Putin indicated would cut that to about 1,500. The Russians, who cannot afford to maintain their current nuclear arsenal, have stated that number before.
The Russian president, clearly concerned about verifying cuts and making sure no successor to Mr. Bush reverses course, appeared to insist, however, on written agreements. Russia, he said at the news conference, was "prepared to present all our agreements in a treaty form" -- exactly what Mr. Bush wants to avoid. Excerpts, Page A13. 
At the embassy, Mr. Putin reiterated his belief in treaties, while appearing to leave room to agree to let the administration pursue missile tests so long as it does not abandon the ABM treaty outright.
It remained unclear whether the differences reflected a gulf that cannot be bridged, or were part of a choreographed scenario to damp expectations about their meeting in Texas.
In a brief conversation after Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin spoke, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell seemed to acknowledge that the talks on amending the ABM Treaty would take longer than he hoped, and perhaps had hit serious obstacles. He warned against expecting the kind of quick accord that Mr. Putin seemed to hint at in recent days.
"You got the public statement that you are going to get and live with for some time," Secretary Powell said. Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, echoed the sentiment, joining the conversation to say, "Don't expect any particular agreement at a particular time."
Mr. Bush has made no secret of his view that the ABM Treaty -- and by implication other arms control treaties -- are outdated relics of the cold war. Today, he repeated his distaste for "endless hours of arms control discussions," and suggested that his oral commitment to reduce American arms levels should be sufficient in a new relationship based on trust. With an arch voice, he added, "If we need to write it down on a piece of paper, I'd be glad to do that."
Mr. Putin, at the Russian Embassy, took a markedly different tack. "Indeed, today the world is far from having international relations based solely on trust," he said. "That is why it's so important today to rely on the existing foundation of treaties and agreements in the arms control and disarmament areas."
Their first four-hour meeting at the White House seemed somewhat more tense and formal than their last three sessions this year.
Nonetheless, Mr. Bush characterized today's session, the first of a three-day summit meeting, as "a new day in the history of Russian-American relations, a day of progress and a day of hope."
By the time they met with reporters in the East Room this afternoon, the two leaders sought to emphasize that their four meetings this year had turned them from competitors into allies, and they announced steps to tighten economic links and smooth Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization, which China joined last weekend. 
Mr. Bush promised to speed through Congress legislation taking Russia and other former Soviet republics off the list of countries that are subject to economic sanctions under the cold-war-era Jackson-Vanik amendment, which was aimed at nations that restricted emigration of Jews and others. "We intend to dismantle conclusively the vestiges of the cold war," Mr. Putin said. 
But the show of warmth could not mask the many indications that despite the agreements and a common belief in the need to fight terrorism, the long-awaited meeting here and at the Bush ranch in Crawford on Wednesday and Thursday may fall short of optimistic expectations.
Mr. Putin had talked extensively before his arrival about his willingness to make compromises that might amend the ABM Treaty, or at least find a way around the restrictions that prevent the United States from proceeding with tests of its antimissile systems.
"We have different points of view about the ABM Treaty," Mr. Bush declared after the meeting, though he said the two men planned to discuss it further at the ranch. Other officials said they were unable to resolve impediments that had stymied American and Russian negotiators in long sessions in the last three days.
The United States now has between 6,000 and 7,000 weapons deployed, depending on how the weapons are counted. That is down sharply from more than 15,000 strategic warheads at the height the cold war. The Start II treaty, which has never been fully carried out, mandates cuts to around 3,000 weapons. 
But Mr. Bush said his own review of America's nuclear posture, completed last week, had led him to conclude that the United States could eliminate more than two-thirds of its weapons. By giving a range of numbers, rather than one specific figure, he essentially opted not to resolve a dispute with the Pentagon about exactly how many weapons would be required a decade from now. 
He also slightly changed the way weapons are counted: A statement issued by the White House referred to operational nuclear weapons -- a figure that would seem to exclude the hundreds being refurbished or inspected at any given time. 
Not surprisingly, much of the discussion at the White House was dominated by talk of military strategy in Afghanistan, how to contain the Northern Alliance if it continues to sweep south and ousts the Taliban, and how a post-Taliban government could be established in Afghanistan. 
The discussion in itself illustrated how far the two countries have traveled since 1989, when the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan after a decade of cold war conflict against Afghan warriors financed and armed by the United States.
Today, Mr. Putin suggested that the joint consultation and action of the last two months was a model for a new military relationship, not only with Washington but also with NATO, the organization created to contain the Soviet Union. "We consider that there are opportunities for an entirely new mechanism," Mr. Putin said, that included "joint decision-making, and coordinated action in the area of security and stability."
Mr. Bush agreed that "NATO members and Russia are increasingly allied against terrorism, regional instability and other threats of our age, and NATO must reflect this alliance." But neither leader publicly mentioned the possibility of eventual Russian membership in NATO, something Mr. Putin discussed at their first encounter, in Slovenia earlier this year.
They still had significant divergences over the campaign in Afghanistan.
Mr. Bush warned the Northern Alliance to halt the widely reported executions of wounded and captured Taliban soldiers. Mr. Putin took a different tack, suggesting that the Taliban were getting what they deserved. "We tend to forget now the atrocities by the Taliban," he said.
He suggested that some of the reports of executions by the Northern Alliance in the Kabul area were manufactured, and he noted that the alliance would have little reason to rampage in its traditional strongholds in the north.
The two men moved gingerly on sensitive issues like Russia's military action in Chechnya and Mr. Putin's use of the tax authorities to crack down on some independent -- and critical -- Russian media. 
Instead, the administration convinced Mr. Putin to sign on to a "Russian-American Media Entrepreneurship Dialogue," which they said would involve journalists and media executives in both countries to "explore ways to improve the conditions necessary for media to flourish as a business in Russia." It was cast entirely as a business advisory group, while the White House clearly intended it to focus on press freedom.
"It was as far as they were willing to go," a senior administration official said.
Another statement by the White House concerned American efforts to help Russia improve security for its nuclear material and to dismantle nuclear warheads. Before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the White House had modestly cut those funds.
Now, however, officials fear that Russia and other former Soviet republics are the most likely source of smuggled uranium or plutonium that could fall into the hands of terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, who has often discussed his desire to develop nuclear weapons. Today, the administration turned out a listing of how it wanted to expand assistance soon.
Among the most interesting of today's announcements was one on Russia's plans to pass laws necessary to open its economy in coming months, a major step toward qualifying for membership in the World Trade Organization.

HEADLINE: New Rules for Weapons Cuts 

 BODY:
The last time American and Russian leaders stepped into the East Room of the White House to initiate a new round of nuclear arms reductions, in 1987, they signed an elaborate, painstakingly negotiated treaty. Yesterday George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin used the same setting to unveil a very different approach. President Bush announced steep cuts in America's nuclear arsenal, which President Putin later in the day said he would match. No legally binding treaties were presented or signed. This new method has its advantages. Legislative action in Washington and Moscow, for example, is not needed. It also has some disadvantages. These include the possibility that either party will simply change its mind. 
 Although Moscow says it will be matching Washington's cut, without a treaty it is under no legal obligation to do so, and Washington cannot oblige it to carry out its promised reduction. On the American side, Mr. Bush's plan to reduce long-range nuclear weapons by about two-thirds over the next decade can be readily reversed by the next president or even by Mr. Bush himself. 
 For now, existing arms treaties remain in force, although some, like the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, face an uncertain future. Mr. Bush is keen to change the way Washington and Moscow manage their nuclear relationship. He hopes to replace the familiar system of arms control negotiations with a much simpler process of independent actions anchored by mutual trust and the verbal commitment of national leaders. That may work as long as the two nations have coinciding interests. If those interests diverge, however, there will be no binding accord that requires America and Russia to honor their commitments. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Bush's cuts are welcome and overdue. A decade after the end of the cold war, it makes no sense for the United States to maintain nearly 7,000 nuclear weapons on its missiles, submarines and bombers, or for Russia to maintain nearly 6,000. The oversize Russian arsenal is the more dangerous, since decaying Russian technology poses a risk of accident, poor security arrangements invite theft and high maintenance expenses burden Moscow's strained economy. Realistically, steep Russian reductions still depend on equivalent American reductions, and with the Pentagon assuring Mr. Bush that the nation now needs no more than 1,700 to 2,200 long-range nuclear weapons, there was little reason for delay. 
The new American reductions are in line with Washington's negotiating objectives in recent years. Nearly nine years ago, a treaty negotiated by Mr. Bush's father and Boris Yeltsin set limits between 3,000 and 3,500 for each country's arsenal. Regrettably, political disputes in both countries have so far kept that agreement from being carried out. During the Clinton years, Washington and Moscow announced plans to negotiate a new treaty to reduce total long-range warheads to somewhere between 2,000 and 2,500. 
Moscow has long advertised its desire to see both countries reduce their totals to 1,500 or less, a goal they will now be approaching. 
Over the next two days at Mr. Bush's Texas ranch, the two men will tackle the still unresolved issue of the ABM treaty and American missile defense tests. Mr. Putin has made clear he is willing to accommodate future American testing plans if Washington does not walk away from the treaty. President Bush should accept the Russian offer. Existing treaties that have worked well and helped keep the peace for decades should not be needlessly discarded.

Go Fly A Kite, Taliban

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Our new friends in Afghanistan celebrated taking Kabul. They played some music. They flew a kite. They put a woman newscaster on the radio. They killed some people just because it felt good.
 We give the Northern Alliance an air force and they embarrass us with savage force. 
 The photo spread in The Times yesterday was chilling. The photographer Tyler Hicks captured a tableau of alliance troops on the way into Kabul, dragging a wounded Taliban soldier out of a ditch, unfazed by the camera. After he pleaded for his life, his eyes full of fear, they pulled him up, shot him in the chest and pummeled him with a rifle butt and a grenade launcher.
Some alliance soldiers looted dead bodies for valuables. The U.N. said 100 young Taliban recruits hiding in a school had been killed in Mazar-i-Sharif, and there were reports of ethnic revenge executions in Kabul.
Even as President Bush was saying yesterday that "We continue to work with the Northern Alliance commanders to make sure they respect the human rights of the people that they're liberating," there were more reports of alliance soldiers lynching and stoning Taliban soldiers and dancing on their corpses.
We understand that this is a rough place with an ancient cat's cradle of tribal grudges. As Donald Rumsfeld said yesterday, when he argued that the Taliban should not be granted "moral equivalence": "That piece of real estate has changed hands dozens and dozens of times throughout history, and the carnage has just been unbelievable." The novel "Flashman" lists the pastimes of 19th-century Afghan warlords as "blood feuds, bribery and murder-for-fun." 
And certainly it was gratifying to see women throw off their veils, men shave their beards and the brutish Taliban on the run "like a slaughtered chicken that falls and dies," as their leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, put it. 
Still, the rebel forces' chaotic and grisly entry into the Afghan capital, after the U.S. had ordered them to stay out, illustrated how tough it's going to be to manage our murky new deals with murky people.
The color our foreign policy will be wearing this fall is gray. We have to capture Osama bin Laden and quell terrorism, so the Bush administration is making compromises and offering carrots where it once turned up its nose.
Mr. Rumsfeld bristled defensively when asked about reports of Northern Alliance atrocities. But the retired general Wesley Clark spoke bluntly to Wolf Blitzer: "War is a matter of relative evils. We're not legally responsible for all this and we're probably not going to be able to physically stop it, either."
The world's in a swirl, and things are changing at a dizzying pace.
Our president, once oblivious to Afghanistan, can now discourse on the geography of the Shamali Plain.
Old liaisons and assumptions are turned on their heads. Iran rises to the defense of the country formerly known as The Great Satan. Pakistan's leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, once scorned by America, now chummily talks over higher textile quotas with Colin Powell. Mr. Powell acknowledges the Bush team needs to work hard on the Middle East peace process it once ignored, to jump-start the Palestinian economy "and remove the level of humiliation that exists in the region."
In an odd twist yesterday, it was the Russian president who defended the American president when a Russian reporter asked Mr. Bush about American curbs on freedom of the press, referring to Condoleezza Rice's successful lobbying of TV executives to keep Osama bin Laden's videos off the air.
In another strange reversal, Mr. Bush did not care about the Reagan dictum "Trust but verify." Talking about their agreement to reduce strategic nuclear arms, Mr. Bush used the word "trust" three times and said they could make the deal on a handshake, while Mr. Putin said, "The world is far from having international relations be based solely on trust." 
Mr. Bush said yesterday that the war on terrorism had "transformationed" the U.S.-Russia relationship.
The two men are so chummy now that when Mr. Bush called Mr. Putin to invite him to the ranch, the Russian president said he was looking forward to riding horses with the American president. Mr. Bush had to explain that he doesn't ride. He prefers to saddle up his jeep or his golf cart, Gator, around the ranch.

 Change in Afghanistan

A CHAIN OF RETREATS -- In a rapid turn of events after weeks of fighting, Taliban forces in effect ceded half of Afghanistan to the American-backed Northern Alliance within hours. The soldiers retreated from city after city into the south. A1

MOVING INTO KABUL -- Defying American demands that they stay out of Kabul, Northern Alliance soldiers streamed into the city after Taliban forces retreated. A1

NEW QUESTIONS -- The sudden collapse of Kabul was something of a victory for American forces who have kept the airstrikes coming. But it also raised problems, in the form of unruly Northern Alliance soldiers and an obsolete strategy. A1

THE TALIBAN'S PATH -- Analysts foresee few strategic options left for the Taliban. Most agree that the soldiers are likely to retreat into the mountains as a guerrilla force, clinging to the places and tactics that gave Soviet troops so many problems. B1

A QUICK ABOUT-FACE -- Led by reports of a Taliban commander's defection in Kunduz, Northern Alliance soldiers rushed to the town. But they were met by rockets and gunfire, and an expected triumph turned into a panicked rout. B1

BIN LADEN'S TRAIL -- American intelligence officials said that Osama bin Laden was on the run with his security forces in southern Afghanistan. The officials said he hadn't tried to leave the country. B2

MOVING THE FRONT -- Seeking to capitalize on disarray among Taliban forces, the United States military bombed retreating troops and quickly moved to bring airfields closer to the shifting battle lines. B3

ABDUCTED WORKERS -- As the Taliban began withdrawing from Kabul, eight aid workers thought they would be freed. Instead, they were quickly jammed into trucks and hauled away, bound for Kandahar. B5

The Response

REACTION IN PAKISTAN -- News of the Northern Alliance's entering Kabul was met with anger and talk of retribution by the largely Pashtun population of northern Pakistan. B1

ATROCITY REPORTS -- Reports of massacres in Afghanistan have brought heated denials from American officials. But the only thing sure is that it is impossible to be sure. B3

PLANS IN THE U.N. -- Spurred into action by the unexpected fall of Kabul, the United Nations quickly sought to start talks on a provisional government for the capital. B4

TALKS IN THE SOUTH -- An official in the pre-Taliban Afghan government said he was in contact with Taliban forces in southern Afghanistan to try to find a peaceful solution for a new government. B5

America's Moves

TRIALS AND DETENTIONS -- President Bush signed an order allowing military tribunals for foreigners charged with terrorism. Also, the Justice Department asked law enforcement authorities across the country to pick up and question 5,000 men who entered the country legally in the past two years, most from Middle Eastern countries. A1

LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS -- Law experts questioned the symbolism of President Bush's decision to allow military terrorism trials, saying it raised questions about the nation's commitment to its basic values. B8

RAID IN PENNSYLVANIA -- More than 30 federal agents backed by hazardous materials crews raided two residents in Chester, Pa. They carried away sealed bags of belongings, questioned occupants and taped off the properties. B7

AIR SECURITY DEADLOCK -- House and Senate negotiators took up a compromise proposal on aviation security, but reportedly remained far apart on an agreement. B7

ANTHRAX LETTERS -- Investigators said they have found new evidence that mail containing anthrax spores was specifically sent to the State Department rather than being cross-contaminated by a letter sent to Senator Tom Daschle. B7

ECONOMIC NEGOTIATIONS -- Senate leaders and the Bush administration agreed to negotiations over an economic stimulus package, but House Republicans blocked the talks. B7

Aftermath in New York

ANTHRAX TRAINING -- In smaller New York municipalities, harried police and emergency workers are having to rely on volunteers and informal training to catch up with anthrax safety procedures. B6

CAROLINA'S KINDNESS -- Students at a middle school in Columbia, S.C., said they had raised more than $447,000 to buy a new fire truck for the New York Fire Department to replace one destroyed in the trade center attacks. B6

A CAUTIOUS CHRISTMAS -- The United States Postal Service said yesterday that thousands of letters addressed by New York City children to St. Nick, the North Pole and even to that second home of reindeer -- the Bronx Zoo -- will be irradiated against anthrax. B6

Repercussions in Europe

SCHRODER'S SHOWDOWN -- The German chancellor called a parliamentary vote of confidence for Friday over his decision to deploy troops to support the war in Afghanistan. The move puts pressure on the junior group in his coalition, the pacifist Greens. A6

ARRESTS IN SPAIN -- The Spanish police arrested 11 people and accused them of recruiting volunteers to carry out attacks for Osama bin Laden's group, Al Qaeda. It was the second time in two months the country has moved against suspected Al Qaeda cells. B6

The Arts

TERRORISM IN THE LIBRETTO -- The Boston Symphony Orchestra dropped three opera choruses from its performance program after Sept. 11 out of concern about their subject matter -- a slaying during the Achille Lauro hijacking by Palestinian terrorists. It has brought anger from the opera's composer, and a debate about sensitivity and artistic responsibility. E3

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ECONOMIC LEGISLATION; 
House G.O.P. Rejects Stimulus-Bill 'Summit'

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Senate leaders and the Bush administration agreed today to bipartisan high-level negotiations by Congress and the White House on an economic stimulus package, but House Republicans blocked any talks, at least for the moment.
 "I don't understand the need for this summit," said Representative Bill Thomas of California, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. And John Feehery, spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said: "Our leadership is pretty leery of some kind of a budget summit. The Senate needs to get a bill passed." 
 But unlike the House, which passed its own economic recovery bill last month, the Senate has no immediate prospect of passing any such package, and House leaders know it.
Today the Senate began debating a Democratic bill that its advocates acknowledge cannot be passed. Senator Max Baucus of Montana, chairman of the Finance Committee, said, "We're not going to get anything out of the Senate, because neither side has 60 votes," the number required to overcome procedural objections.
Senate Democrats want a stimulus package to have a heavy emphasis on help for the unemployed; Republicans of both houses are emphasizing tax cuts. The Senate Democrats have been unwilling to compromise with Senate Republicans alone, fearing that they would then have to retreat still further in a House-Senate conference, a prospect hardly unwelcome to the House Republicans who are shunning negotiations now.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said today that the Democrats had "a legitimate point," and persuaded Senate Republicans to go along with the summit approach. That approach also has strong support from the administration. When President Bush met with the four top Congressional leaders for breakfast this morning, leadership aides said, he told them he wanted a stimulus bill settled this week and would do whatever was needed to help.
Paul H. O'Neill, secretary of the Treasury, was identified by Mr. Baucus and Mr. Lott as the administration figure who would join the bipartisan House-Senate talks. Michele Davis, assistant secretary of the Treasury for public affairs, said Mr. O'Neill "absolutely" wanted to meet with the lawmakers although nothing had been scheduled.
"We want to get a stimulus package that really stimulates the economy," Ms. Davis added. "We'll take any process that gets us there."
But disagreement on whether tax cuts, as in the Republican approach, or additional unemployment benefits and subsidized health insurance, favored by the Democrats, are the best antirecession medicine is hardly the only problem the legislation faces. Republicans are attacking Senate Democrats' effort to add to it $15 billion in spending for homeland defense, which they argue will also help stimulate the economy. (House Democrats, their chance to affect the stimulus legislation past, are now seeking to add $7 billion to a military spending bill for the same purpose.) 
The Senate Democrats scaled back this sum to $15 billion from an original $20 billion to make it less vulnerable to attack as an example of pork-barrel spending. But that reduction produced no sympathy from Republicans, who have told Democrats that they plan to raise a point of order against the provision on Wednesday. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, has insisted that he wants the homeland measure to be part of any negotiations.
In debate today on the Democrats' $66.4 billion measure (without the homeland defense package), Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said: "People want a job. They don't want unemployment checks."
Mr. Grassley argued that tax cuts were the best way to create investment and, with it, employment. 
Senator Grassley also complained that the Democrats were seeking political advantage, instead of letting him and Mr. Baucus work out a compromise.
But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, "The Republicans would rely almost exclusively on permanent tax cuts, which will do little or nothing to promote growth when we need it most -- which is right now."
In contrast, Mr. Kennedy said, the Democratic bill "rightly gives first priority to the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs in the current sagging economy."
"It puts money in the hands of those who will spend it immediately," he said, "and helps laid-off workers provide health insurance for their families."

HEADLINE: THE BUSH-PUTIN SUMMIT; 
In 2 Presidents' Words: The 'New Relationship' Moves to Antiterrorism

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference by President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today at the White House, as transcribed by the Federal News Service Inc. Mr. Putin's remarks were interpreted by a translator.

OPENING STATEMENT
By President Bush
 Thank you. It's a great honor for me to welcome President Vladimir Putin to the White House, and to welcome his wife as well. 
 This is a new day in the long history of Russian-American relations, a day of progress and a day of hope. The United States and Russia are in the midst of a transformationed relationship that will yield peace and progress. We're transforming our relationship from one of hostility and suspicion to one based on cooperation and trust that will enhance opportunities for peace and progress for our citizens and for people all around the world. 
The challenge of terrorisms makes our close cooperation on all issues even more urgent. Russia and America share the same threat and the same resolve. We will fight and defeat terrorist networks wherever they exist. Our highest priority is to keep terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Today we agreed that Russian and American experts will work together to share information and expertise to counter the threat from bioterrorism. We agree that it is urgent that we improve the physical protection and accounting of nuclear materials, and prevent illicit nuclear trafficking, and we will strengthen our efforts to cut off every possible source of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, materials and expertise. . . . 
As Russia and the United States work more closely to meet new 21st century threats, we're also working hard to put the threats of the 20th century behind us once and for all. And we can report great progress. Current levels of our nuclear forces do not reflect today's strategic realities. I have informed President Putin that the United States will reduce our operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to a level between 1,700 and 2,200 over the next decade, a level fully consistent with American security.
Russia and the United States have also had vast discussions about our defensive capabilities, the ability to defend ourselves as we head into the 21st century. We have different points of view about the ABM treaty, and we will continue dialogue and discussions about the ABM treaty so that we may be able to develop a new strategic framework that enables both of us to meet the true threats of the 21st century as partners and friends, not as adversaries. 
The spirit of partnership that now runs through our relationship is allowing the United States and Russia to form common approaches to important regional issues. In the Middle East, we agree that all parties must take practical actions to ease tensions so that peace talks can resume. We urge the parties to move without delay to implement the Tenet work plan and the Mitchell report recommendations. In Europe we share a vision of a European-Atlantic community whole, free and at peace, one that includes all of Europe's democracies and where the independence and sovereignty of all nations are respected. 
Russia should be a part of this Europe. We will work together with NATO and NATO members to build new avenues of cooperation and consultation between Russia and NATO. NATO members and Russia are increasingly allied against terrorism, regional instability and other threats of our age, and NATO must reflect this alliance. 
We are encouraged by President Putin's commitment to a political dialogue in Chechnya. Russia has also made important strides on emigration and the protection of religious and ethnic minorities, including Russia's Jewish community. 
On these issues, Russia is a fundamentally different place than it was during the Soviet era. President Putin told me that these gains for freedom will be protected and expanded. Our foreign ministers have sealed this understanding in an exchange of letters. Because of this progress, my administration will work with Congress to end the application of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to Russia. Russia has set out to strengthen free-market institutions and the rule of law. . . . Russia and the United States will continue to face complex and difficult issues, yet we made great progress in a very short period of time. Today, because we're working together, both our countries and the world are more secure and safe. I want to thank President Putin for the spirit of our meetings.
Together we're making history as we make progress. Laura and I are looking forward to welcoming the Putins to our ranch in Crawford, Tex. Can't wait to show you my state and where I live. In the meantime, I hope you have a fine stay here in Washington, D.C. And it's my honor to welcome you to the White House, sir, and welcome you to the podium.

OPENING STATEMENT
By President Putin
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether I would have an opportunity to address such a representative audience of the press and media. I would like to begin, anyway, with words of thanks to the president of the United States, not only for his kind invitation to visit the United States and Washington, but also for his very informal initiation of our negotiations earlier today. Myself and my colleagues are very pleased to be here, this historic building of the White House. 
And President Bush deemed it appropriate not only to tour me, to guide me through the premises of this house where he lives, we saw almost every picture hanging on the walls of this great building. But it's not only very interesting, but it also changes for the better the quality of our relationship.
I would like to once again thank the president and the American people, and I would like to express our condolences in connection with the recent plane crash in the United States. As they say in Russia, the tragedy does not come alone. Tragedies always come in many numbers. I am confident that the U.S. -- American people -- would face this tragedy very bravely.
I would like to inform you that the Washington part of our negotiations is being completed, and our discussions proved very constructive, interesting and useful, and will continue at Crawford. But the preliminary results we evaluate as extremely positive. 
This is our fourth meeting with President Bush in the last few months. I believe this is a vivid demonstration of the dynamic nature of the Russian-American relations. We have come to understand each other better, and our positions are becoming closer on the key issues of bilateral and international relations. We are prepared now to seek solutions in all areas of our joint activities. We intend to dismantle conclusively the vestiges of the cold war and to develop a new -- entirely new -- partnership for long term. 
Of course, we discussed in detail the subject matter of the fight against terrorism. The tragic developments of Sept. 11 demonstrated vividly the need for a joint effort to counter this global threat. We consider this threat as a global threat indeed, and the terrorists and those who will help them should know that the justice is inescapable and it will reach them wherever they try to hide. . . . 
We discussed in detail our dialogue related to strategic offensive and defensive weapons. Here we managed to achieve certain progress. First of all, it has to do with the prospects of reaching a reliable and verifiable agreement on further reductions of the U.S. and Russian weapons. Here, I must say, we appreciate very much the decision by the president to reduce strategic offensive weapons to the limits indicated by him, and we, for our part, will try to respond in kind. 
On the issues of missile defense, the position of Russia remains unchanged, and we agreed to continue a dialogue and consultations on this. I believe that it's too early now to draw the line under the discussions of these issues, and we will have an opportunity to continue the work on this, one of the very difficult issues, at the Crawford ranch. 
We also exchanged on a number of topical issues of international importance -- the Balkans, Iraq. And we reiterated in a joint statement the resolve of the United States and Russia to facilitate settlement in the Middle East and the early resumption of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. 
We also discussed seriously the development of relations between Russia and NATO, including taking into account a changed international situation. We consider that there are opportunities for an entirely new mechanism, joint decision making and coordinated action in the area of security and stability. 
We considered in detail a number of economic-cooperation issues. The Russian-American dialogue on this area has become recently more constructive and more tangible. Such major investment projects as Sakhalin 1 and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium are gaining momentum, successful cooperation in the air, space, mining, chemistry, car-building and other industries. Direct contacts are expanding between entrepreneurs of the two countries, including within the Russian- American Business Dialogue.
It is with satisfaction that we note a certain progress in issues related to Russia's accession to the W.T.O., in recognizing Russia as a market-economy country. And we felt a great deal of understanding that such issues should be resolved, I mean dealing with the Jackson-Vanik amendment, not de facto, but in legal terms. And in this context, our foreign minister and the secretary of state, Messrs Ivanov and Powell, exchanged letters reiterating the resolve of Russia and the United States to observe human rights and religious freedoms. 
Of course, the capabilities embedded in the bilateral relationship have not been fully implemented, and here we have quite a lot of things to do. But we are confident that the success is, by and large, predetermined by our resolve to cooperate energetically and constructively. That, and I am confident, would benefit both countries and which is reflected also in our visit to this country today.
Thank you.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q. Specific numbers were mentioned here with regard to the reductions of offensive weapons. When and if at all one could expect that such specific numbers made public be substantiated by some papers? Maybe during a possible visit by President Bush to Moscow? And by the way, when could his visit take place?

MR. BUSH: Got to get invited first. You want to start? Or you want --

MR. PUTIN: President Bush is aware of that, and I would like to reiterate he has an open invitation to visit the Russian Federation with an official working or a private visit in any format at any time convenient for me. I mean the best time would be during the time of the beginning of the year, white nights in St. Petersburg. Of course, the official part would start in Moscow, in the capital of the Russian Federation. . . .

MR. BUSH: Yes. I think it's interesting to note that a new relationship based upon trust and cooperation is one that doesn't need endless hours of arms control discussions. I can remember watching the news years ago and seeing that people would sit at tables for hours and hours and hours, trying to reach reduced levels of nuclear armament. . . .

Q. You mentioned past discussions on the ABM treaty. What progress are you making and are you convinced you won't have to withdraw from the treaty now?

MR. BUSH: Well, I'm convinced that the treaty is outdated and we need to move beyond it. And we're having discussions along those lines. We had good discussions today. We had good discussions in Shanghai. We had good discussions in Slovenia, and we'll have good discussions in Crawford. This is obviously a subject that's got a lot of ramifications to it. I clearly heard what the president has had to say in his view of the ABM treaty. He's heard what I've had to say. And we'll continue working it. But my position is is that it's a piece of paper that's codified a relationship that no longer exists. It codified a hateful relationship. And now we have got a friendly relationship.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED; 
President Bush's Order on the Trial of Terrorists by Military Commission

 BODY:
Following is the military order signed by President Bush yesterday on the detention, treatment and trial of noncitizens in the war on terrorism:
 By the authority vested in me as president and as commander in chief of the armed forces of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution (Public Law 107-40, 115 Stat. 224) and sections 821 and 836 of title 10, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
 Section 1.
Findings.

(A) International terrorists, including members of al Qaeda, have carried out attacks on United States diplomatic and military personnel and facilities abroad and on citizens and property within the United States on a scale that has created a state of armed conflict that requires the use of the United States armed forces.

(B) In light of grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism, including the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, on the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense in the national capital region, on the World Trade Center in New York, and on civilian aircraft such as in Pennsylvania, I proclaimed a national emergency on Sept. 14, 2001 (Proclamation 7463, Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks).

(C) Individuals acting alone and in concert involved in international terrorism possess both the capability and the intention to undertake further terrorist attacks against the United States that, if not detected and prevented, will cause mass deaths, mass injuries, and massive destruction of property, and may place at risk the continuity of the operations of the United States government.

(D) The ability of the United States to protect the United States and its citizens, and to help its allies and other cooperating nations protect their nations and their citizens, from such further terrorist attacks depends in significant part upon using the United States armed forces to identify terrorists and those who support them, to disrupt their activities, and to eliminate their ability to conduct or support such attacks.

(E) To protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order pursuant to section 2 hereof to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.

(F) Given the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism, and to the extent provided by and under this order, I find consistent with section 836 of title 10, United States Code, that it is not practicable to apply in military commissions under this order the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts.

(G) Having fully considered the magnitude of the potential deaths, injuries, and property destruction that would result from potential acts of terrorism against the United States, and the probability that such acts will occur, I have determined that an extraordinary emergency exists for national defense purposes, that this emergency constitutes an urgent and compelling government interest, and that issuance of this order is necessary to meet the emergency.
Section 2.
Definition and Policy.

(A) The term "individual subject to this order" shall mean any individual who is not a United States citizen with respect to whom I determine from time to time in writing that:
(1) there is reason to believe that such individual, at the relevant times,
(i) is or was a member of the organization known as al Qaeda;
(ii) has engaged in, aided or abetted, or conspired to commit, acts of international terrorism, or acts in preparation therefor, that have caused, threaten to cause, or have as their aim to cause, injury to or adverse effects on the United States, its citizens, national security, foreign policy, or economy; or
(iii) has knowingly harbored one or more individuals described in subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of subsection 2(a)(1) of this order; and 
(2) it is in the interest of the United States that such individual be subject to this order.

(B) It is the policy of the United States that the secretary of defense shall take all necessary measures to ensure that any individual subject to this order is detained in accordance with section 3, and, if the individual is to be tried, that such individual is tried only in accordance with section 4.

(C) It is further the policy of the United States that any individual subject to this order who is not already under the control of the secretary of defense but who is under the control of any other officer or agent of the United States or any state shall, upon delivery of a copy of such written determination to such officer or agent, forthwith be placed under the control of the secretary of defense.
Section 3.
Detention Authority of the Secretary of Defense.
Any individual subject to this order shall be --

(A) detained at an appropriate location designated by the secretary of defense outside or within the United States;

(B) treated humanely, without any adverse distinction based on race, color, religion, gender, birth, wealth, or any similar criteria;

(C) afforded adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment;

(D) allowed the free exercise of religion consistent with the requirements of such detention; and

(E) detained in accordance with such other conditions as the secretary of defense may prescribe.
Section 4.
Authority of the Secretary of Defense Regarding Trials of Individuals Subject to This Order.

(A) Any individual subject to this order shall, when tried, be tried by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may be punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law, including life imprisonment or death.

(B) As a military function and in light of the findings in section 1, including subsection (f) thereof, the secretary of defense shall issue such orders and regulations, including orders for the appointment of one or more military commissions, as may be necessary to carry out subsection (a) of this section.

(C) Orders and regulations issued under subsection (b) of this section shall include, but not be limited to, rules for the conduct of the proceedings of military commissions, including pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, modes of proof, issuance of process, and qualifications of attorneys, which shall at a minimum provide for --
(1) military commissions to sit at any time and any place, consistent with such guidance regarding time and place as the secretary of defense may provide;
(2) a full and fair trial, with the military commission sitting as the triers of both fact and law;
(3) admission of such evidence as would, in the opinion of the presiding officer of the military commission (or instead, if any other member of the commission so requests at the time the presiding officer renders that opinion, the opinion of the commission rendered at that time by a majority of the commission), have probative value to a reasonable person;
(4) in a manner consistent with the protection of information classified or classifiable under Executive Order 12958 of April 17, 1995, as amended, or any successor Executive Order, protected by statute or rule from unauthorized disclosure, or otherwise protected by law,
(a) the handling of, admission into evidence of, and access to materials and information, and 
(b) the conduct, closure of, and access to proceedings;
(5) conduct of the prosecution by one or more attorneys designated by the secretary of defense and conduct of the defense by attorneys for the individual subject to this order;
(6) conviction only upon the concurrence of two-thirds of the members of the commission present at the time of the vote, a majority being present;
(7) sentencing only upon the concurrence of two-thirds of the members of the commission present at the time of the vote, a majority being present; and
(8) submission of the record of the trial, including any conviction or sentence, for review and final decision by me or by the secretary of defense if so designated by me for that purpose.
Section 5.
Obligation of Other Agencies to Assist the Secretary of Defense.
Departments, agencies, entities, and officers of the United States shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, provide to the secretary of defense such assistance as he may request to implement this order.

Section 6.
Additional Authorities of the Secretary of Defense.

(A) As a military function and in light of the findings in section 1, the secretary of defense shall issue such orders and regulations as may be necessary to carry out any of the provisions of this order.

(B) The secretary of defense may perform any of his functions or duties, and may exercise any of the powers provided to him under this order (other than under section 4(c)(8) hereof) in accordance with section 113(d) of title 10, United States Code.
Section 7.
Relationship to Other Law and Forums.

(A) Nothing in this order shall be construed to --
(1) authorize the disclosure of state secrets to any person not otherwise authorized to have access to them;
(2) limit the authority of the president as commander in chief of the armed forces or the power of the president to grant reprieves and pardons; or
(3) limit the lawful authority of the secretary of defense, any military commander, or any other officer or agent of the United States or of any state to detain or try any person who is not an individual subject to this order.

(B) With respect to any individual subject to this order --
(1) military tribunals shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to
offenses by the individual; and

(D) For purposes of this order, the term "state" includes any state, district, territory, or possession of the United States.

(E) I reserve the authority to direct the secretary of defense, at anytime hereafter, to transfer to a governmental authority control of any individual subject to this order. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the authority of any such governmental authority to prosecute any individual for whom control is transferred.
Section 8.

HEADLINE: Developers at the Door, Ranchers Round Up Support 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. 

 BODY:
LIKE the weather-worn fences traversing the landscape, history holds its ground here. It lies tenderly in waiting whenever Jack and Wanda Redmond sip tea in the kitchen of his family homestead, where until remodeled several years ago, the walls were insulated with pages from a Ladies' Home Journal of 1894.
 "You think about stacking the loose stalks of hay, milking the cows and then shipping the cream in cans to Denver to pay the grocery bills," said Ms. Redmond, 73. "You think about wading through mud or snow with a lamb in each hand to get them out of inclement weather, losing an overshoe along the way. The miles of irrigation ditches put in with a pick and shovel. The self-sufficiency this family had to survive." 
 Down dirt roads with no names that wind for miles across cattle guards and over steep rugged divides, the question of survival has new urgency on ranches like the Redmonds', which have been in families for generations. 
Betty Neish, 83, takes brisk walks over the hills to the Hudspeth place, once her neighbors Art and Florence Hudspeth's land and now a cluster of duplexes with a tennis court and a golf course, part of a development called Catamount. The Neishes' former ranch, which she and her husband, William, sold in the mid-70's, is also now part of Catamount. 
Mrs. Neish lives in her original house. Her dining room window looks out on another ranch, where quarter horses run free; her kitchen looks at an 8,000-square-foot home going up (price, $4.9 million) on part of the 2,000 acres she and her husband sold. "We wanted to do something else with our lives," she said, "and it seemed like more money than we ever heard of. Hindsight is a great teacher."
Here in Routt County, where ranchers, environmentalists and preservationists have come together to take an aggressive stance to protect ranch lands, the pressures bearing down on ranches throughout the West are evident. Between 1992 and 1997, Colorado lost 99,500 acres of farm and ranch land, twice the amount of the previous five years, according to the American Farmland Trust. In this county's ski capital, trophy houses in the style of Yosemite' s Ahwanee Lodge are springing up on former ranches. Call them Ahwahneebes.
Ranches are being sold off at a rapid rate, reflecting both development pressure and the grim economics and consolidation of the cattle industry. A typical rancher in Routt County makes $28,827 a year on land that is worth more than $6.5 million as real estate, said C. J. Mucklow, the county's agricultural extension agent.
In the last decade, slightly more than half of the county's ranch land, over 400,000 acres, has changed hands, sometimes more than once, said William R. Travis, a geographer with the Center for the American West at the University of Colorado. "Ranches have been of interest to nonranchers ever since ranches were invented," Mr. Travis added, "but this is the pivotal decade."
In Routt County, issues of open space and wildlife habitat prompted a local tax to support conservation easements. The county has become home to seven active land trusts, including the Yampa Valley Land Trust and the Colorado Cattlemen's Agricultural Land Trust, the nation's first trust founded by ranchers. 
With help from $40 million in state lottery funds, groups like the Yampa Valley Land Trust help independent small-scale ranchers like the Redmonds, who live near town, keep their land through giving up development rights in exchange for tax benefits. Two weeks ago, Colorado voters passed a referendum that allows the state to issue $150 million in bonds to protect open lands. 
Preservationists are listing buildings on the state register to qualify them for tax benefits, and painstakingly recording these fragile repositories of the country's history even as they vanish. The Colorado State Historical Fund, created in 1990 by a constitutional amendment, provides $20 million a year from gambling revenues for preservation, which has so far helped rescue 36 historic ranches.
Among them is the Carpenter Ranch outside Steamboat Springs, which has one of the oldest operating ranch buildings in Northwest Colorado and is now owned by the Nature Conservancy. There, habitat restoration and historic preservation have been knit together on a working ranch first homesteaded in 1881. 
"Ranchers provide amenities to the public -- open space, wildlife, water -- for which they don't get compensated," said Bruce Runnels, vice president of the conservancy's Rocky Mountain division. "Their heritage and deep love of land underlies the sense of place in these communities."
At Crags Ranch, owned by Judy and Jerry Green, history is as much a part of the landscape as the long-limbed cottonwood trees. Mr. Green's great-grandfather Leon S. Green settled the oldest part of the ranch in 1895; his hand is still evident in now-rickety buildings of burnt-honey-colored boards that were hewn with an adz.
The Greens call it "the lower place," or simply "Grandpa's." He named the land Crags Ranch for the towering sandstone cliffs that shelter this valley like a prayer. His cedar fences still define the perimeter of the meadow he cleared by hand. The ranch is virtually unchanged from Leon Green's day, including the original homestead cabin, a bunkhouse, a dairy barn, a blacksmith cabin, a stacked-stone root cellar, a coal house and a rarity, an entire shed devoted to potatoes. ("He was a gregarious man who loved potatoes," Mr. Green said.)
In every nail, board and tilt, family history resides. Of the plank floor in her old kitchen, Wanda Redmond said, "Of course it shifted all the time -- I always knew which direction the milk was going to run when the kids spilled it."
Ranch houses were often built long after the most important building -- the barn -- went up. Mr. Green, 60, and Mrs. Green, who is 53, live in a double-wide trailer along the river; the barn, built in 1927, bears the names of horses scribbled on the beams. "Barns mean a lot to us," Mr. Green said. "We use them daily. These buildings are all still standing, still working, still efficient."
The main house, set off by a white picket fence, is occupied by Mr. Green's 83-year-old mother, Mabel, who cooks on a coal stove backed up by a microwave and who recently broke her hip while vaccinating cattle. She has kept a daily diary since 1935, when she was 17, providing a record of threshing days, Sunday wash days and the coming of electricity. On her wedding day, she went grocery shopping and fed cattle. "We never did have a honeymoon," she said.
Concern over the future made the Greens quit teaching high school in Grover, Colo., to move back to this isolated valley to raise cattle in 1980. "I guess that lifestyle was just in our blood," Mr. Green said.
Like the owners of many historic ranches, the Greens will face a crossroads: they have no children, though a young nephew is a potential heir. They are listing the ranch on the county register, out of pride, and earlier this fall architecture students from a special ranch preservation program at the University of Colorado at Denver went to the ranch to do schematic drawings. The Greens have not yet pursued a conservation easement.
"The only reason the ranch is still here is because of what Jerry's family put into it in hard times," Mrs. Green said. "We've continued it because we love it, but this way of life is passing. I don't foresee the next generation running it the same way."
She added: "We could sell it and take a Caribbean cruise, but then what would we have?"
JUST as saltboxes define New England and antebellum plantations the South, ranches and their wide-open spaces define the West. The romantic appeal of ranching is summed up in the sales literature for the Catamount Ranch & Club, a new development on nearly 4,000 acres of ranch land: "Don't miss your exclusive opportunity to be part of a rich Colorado heritage!"
"Europeans want castles, Americans want ranches," said Andrew Gulliford, a historian and director of the Center of Southwest Studies at Fort Lewis College in Durango. "They're nostalgic. They're rugged. They're why Reagan was popular."
But for every conservationist like Ted Turner -- whose holdings include Vermejo Park ranch in New Mexico, 100,000 contiguous acres that contain seven ghost towns and an entire watershed -- there are hundreds of "ranchettes," God's 35 acres. 
As land is subdivided into those ranchettes, a cultural shift occurs. "People don't have ties anymore," Jerry Green said. "The new people have come from hither and yon. They don't have the longevity of community, a place that's been in the family for generations."
Many newcomers, despite good intentions, are annoyed by things like cattle on the road; some even use ranchers' irrigation ditches to water their lawns. One man's livelihood is another man's picturesque atmosphere. "It grates on your nerves just a touch, especially when they drive by slowly to see you working," said Bill Gay, a third-generation rancher who has been active in open space issues and has placed a conservation easement on his property. 
Still, Betty Neish, who sold her land, is "terribly grateful" for the scaled-down, ecologically sensitive development at Catamount: the original plan had called for making it a twin ski town for Steamboat in the manner of Aspen/Snowmass.
Jim and Jo Stanko's ranch, three miles outside Steamboat Springs, is now ringed by ranchettes and suburban-style subdivisions. A conservation easement on part of their 650 acres, homesteaded by Mr. Stanko's grandfather in 1907, lowered the potential value of the property enough so that the couple's 31-year-old son, Patrick, an electrical engineer, could afford to become their partner in the ranch. But the Stankos cannot control the neighbors. 
"The hundred and some acres next door that is for sale," he said gloomily, "there could be 300 houses on that." The best protection remains ranching. "There is a big difference between saving ranch land and saving ranching," said Ed McMahon, a vice president of the Conservation Fund, a national land conservation organization, which is trying to do both. "The sense of place comes from it remaining a working landscape, not a petrified one."
The future may partly depend on nontraditional ranchers like Patrick and Tammie Delaney. He is the general manager of Steamboat Resorts, which builds and manages condos, and she is the project coordinator for the Orton Family Foundation, but they hold down second jobs raising yak -- and two children -- on their historic ranch outside Hayden, about an hour from Steamboat Springs. The Delaneys get up at 4:30 in the morning to hurl hay bales out the barn; when they get home, they slip on overalls, praying that some disaster, like a yearling colt bumping into a porcupine, has not occurred. Then they whip up a dinner of, say, espresso and roast yak.
They are hoping to restore their century-old barn, which, viewed from a distance, looms like a dazzling white cathedral. The ranch, Ms. Delaney said, "has been the centering force of our family."
"When you have a place like this you want to honor and celebrate it."
Landscapes have memories, but ranchers are practical people. "We might not save it all," Judy Green said of the place where Greens have rounded up cattle for more than 100 autumns. "But 50 years from now, someone might like to know what we had."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
A Depression Diner, Brimming With Danger and Dreams

BYLINE:  By NEIL GENZLINGER 

 BODY:
Ah, for those carefree Depression days, when bad guys dealt in nice, understandable shoot-'em-ups and strangers could fall hopelessly in love in the time it takes to eat a burger.
 An entertaining trip back to that moment is now available for a mere $15 at the Pantheon Theater, where "The Petrified Forest," Robert E. Sherwood's tale of longing, disillusionment and gunplay, is being given a rare revival that ends this weekend. Neither Leslie Howard nor Humphrey Bogart is on hand for a reprise of his role from the 1935 Broadway version, but this smoothly acted, briskly paced production does just fine without them. 
 The play is of the diner-full-of-dreams genre. This diner is in Black Mesa, Ariz., a place where not a lot happens -- except on this particular day, when just about everything happens. Alan Squier (Christopher Armond, in the Howard role), an unemployed writer on his way to nowhere from no place, stops in and bums a meal from a waitress named Gabby (Kira Jelincic). 
"There is something here that stimulates the autobiographical impulse," Alan muses at one point, and the audience chuckles, because the two have already spilled out their histories and hopes as if they have only two hours to live.
And perhaps they do. Word is drifting in that the notorious outlaw Duke Mantee (Carl Tarcangeli, in Bogart's part) is on the run after doing some serious killing. Guess which roadside joint he stops in? The story plays out with a nice mix of tension, ache and humor, much of the last provided by Gene Burke as a spunky grandpa and Elizabeth Rogers and Richard Springle as a well-off couple who stumble in and create an incongruous domestic disturbance.
You can watch "The Petrified Forest" through any number of filters. Sherwood sprinkled the play with preachy dialogue that reflects the time, and some of it rings interestingly today as we debate loyalty and love of country. There are also moments, when the characters talk about their dreams, that you can't help thinking about what lay ahead for the world in 1935, or what lay ahead for the original production's two principal actors: Bogart seven years away from "Casablanca," Howard eight years away from dying when the passenger plane he was in was shot down by the Germans.
But you don't really need any of that baggage; you can just view this for the well-constructed, well-acted tale that it is. Credit George Loros, the director, who seems to know just how tight to keep the reins to prevent his cast from lapsing into parody. "The Petrified Forest" isn't a great play -- the story is a bit too improbable for that -- but as presented here, it's certainly an enjoyable one.

THE PETRIFIED FOREST

By Robert E. Sherwood; directed by George Loros; sets by Joseph Egan; lighting by Doug Filomena; costumes by Catherine S. Clark; sound by Mario Vaz De Mello. Presented by Pantheon Productions Inc. At the Pantheon Theater, 303 West 42nd Street, second floor, Clinton.

WITH: Vincent LoRusso (Boze Herzlinger), Gene Burke (Gramp Maple), Kira Jelincic (Gabby Maple), Christopher Armond (Alan Squier), Sergio Cacciotti (Jackie), Tyler Reign (Ruby) and Carl Tarcangeli (Duke Mantee).

HEADLINE: Public Theater Cuts Staff To Offset Losses in Funds 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
The Joseph Papp Public Theater has laid off about 20 percent of its staff to balance its budget, citing a downturn in the economy, cuts in city funds and an expected drop in donations. The action follows the resignation of the theater's two largest donors and the departure of its executive director, Fran Reiter, the former deputy mayor of New York who was brought in for her administrative skills less than a year ago. 
 George C. Wolfe, the producer and creative force behind the Public for the last nine years, said the staff cuts, which amount to 20 people out of a staff of about 100, follow a 15 percent reduction to the Public's city funds that the theater learned of last month. 
 "It's just trying to get ahead of what I think is the inevitable," Mr. Wolfe said. "All cultural institutions are going to have to adjust in a certain way."
For the current fiscal year, which started in September, the Public was projecting a shortfall of nearly $700,000 and deficits until fiscal year 2004. Because there is no money in the endowment reserve fund (interest from the endowment) to cover the projected shortfall, staff cuts were necessary, Mr. Wolfe said.
The theater's endowment is now down to about $23 million from $40 million, largely because of its two consecutive Broadway flops -- "On the Town," and "The Wild Party," which together lost $14 million -- and the closing of successful Public productions on Broadway like "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk."
The departure of the board members, Larry E. Condon of the LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust, and Dorothy Cullman, has raised questions about whether their millions of dollars in annual contributions will continue. 
"I think he's doing the appropriate thing," said Kenneth B. Lerer, chairman of the Public's board, referring to Mr. Wolfe's decision. 
In addition, two new members have been added to the board: David Rockefeller, the architect, and Andre Balazs, the hotelier. 
"There has been this extraordinary buoyant energy in the building," Mr. Wolfe said. "It's very sad that this is invading that."

Poison Politics

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Have New York Democrats learned any lessons from the mayoral debacle of 2001? Or are they crazy enough to continue drinking from the poisonous well of ethnic politics?
 The City of New York is going through its toughest period since the Great Depression. Terrorism has left thousands dead. The World Trade Center, the skyline's most distinctive feature, is a mixture of dust and memories. Neighborhoods like Chinatown and Little Italy are struggling to survive. Jobs are vanishing by the scores of thousands. Enormous budget deficits are coming, and perhaps a state takeover of municipal finances as well. 
 The city, as they say, has some issues.
And yet the last time the Democrats were heard from they were squabbling over insults to this group and appeals to that crowd, and ugly pictures and nasty phone calls -- everything except the profoundly important issues of the day.
Last week the voters told them to sit down and shut up. Michael Bloomberg, a nominal Republican with astonishingly deep pockets, was elected mayor in a town that has approximately the same percentage of registered Democrats as the Kennedy family.
Warning bells don't come any louder.
New York is a different place these days, and it's not just because of the World Trade Center attack. This is a more tolerant city than it was just 10 or 20 years ago. We may not have achieved ethnic nirvana, but for whatever reasons (there are many) New Yorkers have gotten better at getting along. Substantial progress has been made since the days when the city was convulsed by killings in places like Howard Beach and Bensonhurst and Crown Heights. 
But there are an awful lot of Democrats behaving as if the calendar somehow got stuck in the 1970's or 80's. Their primary consideration is not policy but how the various ethnic groups can be mixed and matched, and thus exploited. This year's Democratic primary was a study in racial and ethnic cynicism, and the bad feelings it generated undoubtedly contributed to Mark Green's defeat.
It doesn't matter who was at fault at any given moment. Ethnic politics is a lousy game and self-defeating. The fallout from the mayoral race is already tainting the Democrats' effort to win the election for governor next year. A liberal Democrat who is white, Andrew Cuomo, and a liberal Democrat who is black, Carl McCall, are hunting votes in terrain that is dangerously similar to this year's Democratic mayoral primary.
That chuckling you hear is coming from George Pataki.
Some years ago, I interviewed the venerable civil rights leader James Farmer. He told me that he and others made a grave error, even as the civil rights movement was racking up its stunning successes. No long-range planning was done, he said. So future generations never benefited as much as they might have from the dismantling of segregation, the enhancement of voting rights and -- over a period of many years -- increased education and employment opportunities.
I think that many influential Democrats in New York are failing to recognize that some of the party's most important goals -- greater tolerance, increased opportunity, higher levels of racial and ethnic inclusion -- are coming to pass. The party's message and strategies need to change to reflect that reality.
Conversely, the advances made over the past several years will be undermined if Democrats continue to play cynical ethnic games, especially during a time of economic hardship. 
On Monday, when thick plumes of dark smoke were billowing over a residential neighborhood in Queens, the fears of New Yorkers were focused on the possibility of another terrorist attack. And as the details of the crash of American Flight 587 emerged, the city's collective sorrow was focused once again on a huge loss of life and the grief to be endured by those left behind.
The city has changed. And as it makes its way through this very difficult and tragic period, there is less room and less tolerance than ever for cheap racial politicking.
Every group has a grievance. And sometimes it's legitimate. But right now there are other matters on the table. Important matters. So let's give it a rest.

HEADLINE: Nations Back Freer Trade, Hoping to Aid Global Growth 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: DOHA, Qatar, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Reaching a consensus that they hope will rejuvenate the world's economy, trade ministers from more than 140 nations agreed today on an agenda to topple tariffs and liberalize trade on everything from wheat to insurance policies.
 In six days of nearly round-the-clock meetings in this Persian Gulf emirate, the members of the World Trade Organization sought to balance their national interests against the urgent need to shore up the world's battered economy. Their success helped to dispel some of the psychological damage inflicted by the collapse of similar talks in Seattle two years ago. 
 With trade growing at the slowest rate since the early 1980's and the world economy on the brink of recession, negotiators were under intense pressure to act together to stimulate growth. The World Bank estimates that the outline agreed upon today could help add $2.8 trillion to global economic activity by 2015. 
"This agreement sent a powerful signal to the world that we have removed the stain of Seattle," Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, told delegates as the meeting concluded. "We will continue to build a common trading system based on common rules."
Developing nations made out well because the agreement was likely to open markets in industrial countries to their leading exports. It will also open doors for multinational corporations, especially those that provide financial and environmental services, and for agriculture exports.
But if the full extent of the accord is realized in forthcoming negotiations, it could hurt special interest groups around the world that have long enjoyed direct government support for the ability to use domestic rules to limit imports. 
Among the biggest are American textiles, steel and semiconductor companies, as well as small European and Japanese farmers. Longstanding demands by organized labor to have worker rights addressed in trade talks were largely ignored.
Many ministers said the agreement was designed mainly to benefit developing countries, which have complained bitterly that trade rules favor the rich but have begun to hold huge sway within the trade group. 
Among their major gains was an understanding that would help poor countries gain access to less-expensive generic drugs to treat AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases, even at the risk of breaking patents held by major drug companies. This understanding was reached on Monday, after the United States and several African nations declared that patents would not stand in the way of public health.
Speaking of the overall outcome of the talks, Nigeria's commerce minister, Mustafa Bello, said, "This has not been an easy negotiation, but Africa wishes to put on the record that it is satisfied and it approves this declaration."
The W.T.O. also passed a significant milestone when it admitted China and Taiwan as its 143rd and 144th members, meaning that its membership now covers all the major industrial and developing countries with the exception of Russia.
Removing barriers to farm trade was arguably the most significant and certainly the hardest-fought element of the agreement. The United States, Australia, Brazil and many poor countries who feel they have a comparative advantage in farm exports have lobbied for years to cut tariffs and trade-distorting payments for farmers.
Their targets have for years been the European Union, Japan and South Korea, which rigorously shield farmers from foreign competition. Japan reluctantly committed to negotiating reductions in its sky-high tariffs during the latest talks, but Europe refused to eliminate some $4 billion in annual payments it makes to farmers to promote exports.
The pending presidential elections in France, where the farm lobby is strong and farm policies are equated with the French way of life, made the negotiations especially sensitive.
Though the French threatened to make the issue a "deal breaker," France and the European Union agreed to "phasing out" the subsidies. But Europeans added a bit of diplomatic double-speak, suggesting that the goals should not "prejudice the outcome" of negotiations.
There are several degrees of separation between these proposals and action that could affect the price of goods that people buy, meaning that ministers are doing no more than commissioning study groups that could theoretically mandate new trade rules years later. 
But developing countries resisted fiercely, fearing that the negotiations would eventually force them to change their laws and even cede sovereignty. Many countries also tried to prevent Europe from using environmental rules to protect farmers, particularly by refusing to import genetically modified foods.
Even after the success here, doubts remained about the effectiveness of the World Trade Organization. It operates by consensus, meaning individual members can hold the group hostage. The negotiating program had to be watered down so much to obtain agreement that one Japanese trade official called the delicately constructed declaration "a perfect balance of unhappiness."
But there is no doubt that the fate of the trade group would have fared worse had the talks failed. Michael Moore, the organization's director general, thanked delegates tonight for "saving the W.T.O."
Although trade negotiators entered the talks vowing to fight terrorism with commercial solidarity, ministers repeatedly flirted with failure. Rich and poor nations engaged in heated ideological skirmishing even as they battled to defend narrow vested interests, with Ecuadorean bananas and Thai tuna among issues that at times blocked consensus. 
In the end, it took six days of nonstop haggling in a compound hermetically sealed by security guards against a feared terrorist attack to bridge all the gaps.
Mr. Zoellick helped hold the meeting together by making concessions to break deadlocks. He retreated from the American position on medical patent rules to defuse a damaging split between North and South countries, while allowing negotiations on antidumping despite strong opposition from the steel and semiconductor industries.
The apparent flexibility of the Bush administration's position contrasts with the firm stances it took on global warming, germ warfare and other agreements, suggesting that President Bush's international focus since the Sept. 11 attacks has affected the administration's approach to economic matters as well.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
A small dose of common sense would help Congress break the gridlock over airport security.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
"WHEREFORE, security being the true design and end of government," Thomas Paine advised in 1776, "it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others." Such common sense is needed in Congress on aviation security.
 Everyone agrees that the current system, in which barely profitable airlines contract with private companies, provides inadequate incentives for security. Airlines seek the lowest-cost providers. Federal standards are lax and poorly enforced, so security companies provide the bare minimum -- and sometimes less. 
 The main disagreement is whether screening should be contracted out by airports to companies working under federal oversight or whether screeners should be federal employees -- or whether the president should have the flexibility to choose between these models.
Economic logic says you usually get what you pay for. Airline security is no exception. 
Low pay is particularly problematic. Screeners and other security workers are paid the minimum wage or slightly more. Not surprisingly, companies can recruit only minimally skilled workers.
Better security will require employees with enough common sense to search luggage thoroughly if they discover passengers with knives in their pockets, regardless of what federal standards require. Every contingency can never be spelled out.
Low pay also causes high turnover. The General Accounting Office found that annual turnover for screeners varied from 37 percent in Honolulu to 416 percent in St. Louis. The average was 126 percent at the 19 largest airports. 
High turnover has a potentially pernicious effect because it makes it easier for terrorists to get airport jobs. High turnover also raises training costs and reduces the incentive to provide training in the first place.
A new study directed by Michael Reich of the University of California at Berkeley examines the effect of an initiative at San Francisco International Airport that established recruitment, compensation, training and performance standards for all workers in security areas or engaged in security tasks in April 2000. 
Starting pay for screeners rose from $5.91 an hour to $10 plus health benefits. Turnover fell from 95 to 19 percent. Employers reported that morale, skills and performance improved, while absences and grievances fell.
Looking across 19 airports, Professor Reich also found that lower turnover was associated with a greater likelihood of detecting security breaches.
Both the House and Senate bills would raise pay, but the Senate bill -- which federalizes workers -- would raise it more. The House only vaguely authorizes the Transportation Department to set "minimum compensation levels, when appropriate." 
Federal workers would be more likely to unionize, although the Service Employees International Union has made inroads with security workers. It is disingenuous, however, to say unions and Democrats favor federalizing security to increase membership. The service employees' union opposes federalizing the work force (because it would lose members), while the largest government union supports it. If all 28,000 screeners were unionized, membership would increase by only one-tenth of a percent.
Anyway, a more heavily unionized work force would not jeopardize security. Ever since the seminal study by the economists Charles Brown and James Medoff, most studies have found that unions raise productivity, even in the public sector. Unions raise wages and reduce turnover, so it is not surprising they lead to higher productivity, although at higher cost.
European airports, which commonly contract with the private sector for security, provide only limited guidance on the advantages of public versus private employees. First, firing for cause is about as easy in the private sector in Europe as in the public sector here. Second, pay and benefits for low-level workers in Europe are much higher.
The main potential advantage from private contractors stems from their incentive to use resources efficiently. Most important, competition among private companies may result in security innovations.
And the option of contracting to private providers shields government should a terrorist attack occur; government could quickly replace the contractor, giving the appearance (and possibly reality) of improving security. 
The main risk of using private contractors is that they could marshal their resources to influence regulators. Indeed, the Aviation Security Association, a group representing security firms that was formed two days after Sept. 11, is lobbying for bigger budgets and higher pay. Could it be that cost-plus contracts, which lead to increased profit when costs rise, have something to do with their sudden interest in worker pay?
Contracts must be written with safety in mind. The House bill simply leaves this up to the Transportation Department. Companies should be penalized if they fail undercover tests. Profits should not be just a mark-up over cost.
Another risk is a shortage of federal employees to perform the crucial supervision, background checks, training and certification. Federal employment is down 10 percent since 1966.
And will private workers have access to C.I.A., F.B.I. and I.N.S. data networks?
Regardless of who employs the screeners, security issues still remain. "It takes a village to turn around a 747," said Julie Neff, who just retired after 30 years as a flight attendant because her relatives were concerned for her safety. Caterers, cleaners and others have access to planes. "What is missing from both bills but in the San Francisco plan," Professor Reich said, "is the inclusion of higher standards for the other workers who have access to the planes."
President Bush is said to be readying an executive order in case the House and Senate remain gridlocked. So here's a Brandeisian proposal: direct the Transportation Department to contract out screening in some airports and use federal workers in others. Then have the Federal Aviation Administration conduct random undercover tests to see which system is working best.
As Thomas Paine argued, "The representative system of government is calculated to produce the wisest laws, by collecting wisdom where it can be found."

HEADLINE: University of California Moves To Widen Admissions Criteria 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Six years after it eliminated affirmative action based on race and sex in its admissions process, the University of California Board of Regents moved today toward adopting a new policy that would broaden the factors considered in selecting students.
 Among the new factors would be a student's success in overcoming economic and educational disadvantages. The policy was accepted by the Regents' Education Policy Committee on 13-to-2 vote, and it is expected to be approved by the full board on Thursday. 
 The policy, known as comprehensive review, has been criticized as a covert way of reviving race as a factor in admissions, which is banned by state law. But supporters maintain that the new policy looks at how all students, not just poor ones, met challenges and therefore is race neutral.
After race was barred as a consideration in admissions, the university system experienced a sharp decline in the number of minority students, and officials have grappled with how to balance educational excellence with access to the system.
Most recently, they have relied on a two-tiered system. The first tier, which accounted for 50 percent to 75 percent of the students admitted, relies strictly on grade-point averages and test scores. The second tier takes into account factors like the number of advanced courses available at the school attended, extracurricular activities and leadership skills.
The new measure, which would do away with the two-tiered system, was supported by Ward Connerly, a board member who championed the elimination of admissions based on race and sex as well as Proposition 209, which prohibits the use of race and sex in state hiring. Although Mr. Connerly had expressed concern that the change would allow race "to be used through the backdoor," he endorsed the measure after wording was added stipulating that no race preferences of any kind could be applied.
"I think it's incumbent on higher education to look at ways of extending opportunities to those of low and moderate income without regard of their race," Mr. Connerly said. "I think we nudged one step closer to that today."
But those who opposed the measure expressed concern about the system's ability to maintain academic excellence while relying less on academics for admission.
"I do worry about not having a percentage of admissions absolutely required on academic merit alone," said S. Sue Johnson, chairwoman of the Board of Regents.
Michael Reese, the university system's assistant vice president for strategic communication, said changes in the admissions policy were an effort to address the vast disparities among California's schools.

HEADLINE: Demand at Food Pantries Rises, but Donations Drop 

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER 

 BODY:
The slow economy and the loss of thousands of jobs after the World Trade Center attack have heightened demand at food pantries, but the supply of donations is decreasing, according to a study released yesterday by the city's largest food bank.
 The food bank, Food for Survival, took a survey of the soup kitchens they serve in the days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack and found that 64 percent of the people receiving free food in New York were taking donations for the first time. Most of these first-time clients were single mothers who needed emergency food because they had lost their jobs in the attack, said Lucy Cabrera, the president of the food bank. 
 Even before Sept. 11, Dr. Cabrera said, reliance on food donations was greater than last year's. More than 1.5 million New Yorkers, including 510,000 children, relied on soup kitchens, food pantries and shelters to avoid going hungry, Dr. Cabrera said. In 1997, by comparison, about 450,000 people received emergency food donations, she said.
Last month, Food for Survival distributed 28 percent more food to about 1,200 food pantries, homeless shelters and soup kitchens around New York than in October 2000, Dr. Cabrera said at a news conference at the Hunts Point produce market in the Bronx. At the same time, donations from individual contributors decreased by about 30 percent in October compared with the same month last year, she said.
Dr. Cabrera attributed the drop in donations to the fact that regular donors had already given money to charities to help with the fallout from the terrorist attack and could not afford to give much more. 
Even with the decrease in donations, however, Food for Survival has not had to decrease food deliveries, Dr. Cabrera said. Indeed, the food bank sent huge amounts of food to ground zero after the attack.
"We saved up funds because we always knew that a rainy day would come," she explained. "Well, that rainy day came on Sept. 11."
The study, called "Hunger in America 2001: The New York City Report," surveyed 632 emergency food providers in New York and 376 low-income clients.

HEADLINE: Growth in Albany Spending Is Double Rate of Inflation 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
State spending will grow by more than twice the rate of inflation this fiscal year, at a time when the government already faces a shortfall of at least $1.6 billion after the Sept. 11 attacks, budget officials said today.
 The growth in spending has happened even though the government limped along for four months on emergency spending measures and then, in August, the State Legislature passed what lawmakers called a bare-bones budget. 
 Both the emergency appropriations over the summer and the August budget were intended to keep spending at last year's levels until a final budget agreement could be worked out. That final agreement did not come until late October, after the terrorist attack dealt a huge blow to the state's economy. The Legislature added about $168 million in spending this fiscal year, which was paid for with some new revenues, like money from a multistate lottery, and by moving money from other programs. 
But spending still grew. Budget officials estimated today that the part of the budget paid for solely with state taxes -- the general fund -- will total $41.9 billion, about 5.8 percent above last year's figure. 
The entire budget, including federal grants and state revenues earmarked for particular purposes, will grow to $84.3 billion, or 5.7 percent over last year, compared with the 2.2 percent increase in the cost of living for the first six months of this fiscal year, April through September.
"The fact remains that this so-called bare-bones budget isn't bare at all," said Brian Backstrom, an analyst with Change-NY, a conservative group advocating fiscal restraint. "It spends at twice the rate of inflation."
Budget officials for Gov. George E. Pataki say the Legislature is partly to blame for the rise in spending because lawmakers did not approve cuts he requested. For instance, the Assembly and the Senate ultimately rejected plans to cut Medicaid reimbursements to nursing homes by about $138 million and subsidies to buy drugs for the elderly by about $41 million. "The Legislature didn't do the cost containment," said Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for the state budget director, Carole E. Stone. 
At the same time, the state was hit with some new expenses, budget officials said. The faltering stock market meant the state had to make a $44 million contribution to the state pension fund. An unexpected growth in the number of children receiving welfare cost the state $60 million. Several lawsuits cost it $55 million.
Legislative leaders say their rejection of the governor's proposed cutbacks cannot account for the entire growth in the spending this year. "We didn't add any more spending," said John McArdle, a spokesman for the Republican Senate majority. "We just didn't do his cuts."
Dean Fuleihan, the secretary of the Ways and Means Committee in the Democrat-controlled Assembly, said, "It's inconceivable to me that our inaction on their cost-containment measures could possibly get us to that kind of growth."
Budget officials acknowledge that the five emergency spending measures passed over the summer did not, in fact, limit spending to last year's levels, but allowed for increases the governor had built into his January budget proposal. That budget provided for a 3.6 percent increase in general-fund spending. 
Some expenses, like Medicaid and school aid, were driven by last year's formulas and continued to grow faster than inflation over the summer, officials said. In addition, the administration did not spend $300 million budgeted for the last fiscal year until after April 1, adding to this fiscal year's expenses.
The rise in spending could not come at a worse time. Mr. Pataki is predicting that the dropoff in tax revenues because of the devastation in Lower Manhattan could be as much as $3 billion this fiscal year and $6 billion next. He has promised to cut $3 billion over the next 18 months, but has yet to lay out how, beyond a hiring freeze and early retirements.

HEADLINE: N.J. Transit in 'Financial Morass,' Study Says 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Nov. 14 

 BODY:
New Jersey Transit is facing a financial crisis caused in part by its use of state and federal funds intended for long-term projects and maintenance to pay its day-to-day operating costs, an independent study warned today.
 The report, by the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University, says the public transit agency, the nation's third largest, is in a "financial morass," saddled with a growing operating deficit that threatens its ability to meet future needs -- particularly as ridership soars in the aftermath of the terror attacks. 
 The underlying cause of the problem, the study says, is the failure of the State Legislature and several governors to provide adequate operating aid each year, and the state's failure to allow modest fare increases over the last 11 years. As a result, the report says, the agency has diverted about 70 percent of its state and federal capital-improvement funds to short-term expenses. 
But the report went on to blame the agency for spending the remaining 30 percent on new, politically popular projects that are being pursued rapidly and often without strategic planning, adding to the operating deficit. That deficit is now $569 million, about half the size of the current budget.
Among the study's recommendations is a moratorium on new rail projects until elected officials and the agency address the basic problems: chronic underfinancing and diversion of capital funds.
"This is not a simple financial rut from which N.J. Transit can escape with ease," the report said. "With the funding made available to it, N.J. Transit has been directed to overextend itself; use capital to pay operating maintenance expenses, incur too much debt service and use other preservation capital to construct and then operate too many new rail projects."
Jeffrey Warsh, the executive director of the transit agency, which operates the state's heavy commuter rail, light rail and bus lines as well as the Newark subway system, agreed in many ways with the report's assessment. In fact, a similar critique was made by the agency itself in a report released Sept. 10 but was largely ignored outside transit advocacy circles.
Mr. Warsh disagreed, however, with the criticism that the agency had moved too quickly on costly new systems and rail lines. Without the rapid construction on the Hudson Bergen Light Rail system and the near-completion of the Secaucus interchange, he said, the agency will not be ready to handle the sudden increases in ridership in the wake of traffic snares since the trade center attack and the loss of the major PATH station beneath the towers.
"We are seeing a 45 percent increase in ridership that we weren't supposed to see for a decade," Mr. Warsh said. "Yes, we have moved fast, but without that, we would be in bigger trouble than we are after Sept. 11."
Martin E. Robins, the principal author of the report said that with its diversion of capital funds and growing operating deficits, the agency is "operating on two of its six cylinders." 
He said that roughly $236 million in capital funds is being diverted each year to daily operations that ought to be devoted to meeting future needs. New Jersey Transit has been able to dodge the immediate problem of inadequate state operating assistance through changes in laws that have given it more flexibility in how it spends federal capital funds. The State Legislature has also relaxed its rules on how the agency can use Transportation Trust Fund money normally earmarked for long-term investments.
"Some of this gap could be addressed through fare increases," Mr. Robins said in the study, "but the lion's share of responsibility rests with appropriations from the next gubernatorial administration and the State Legislature."
Because each 5 percent fare increase would net only $25 million, Mr. Robins said that even a 10 percent increase would not come close to meeting the agency's needs.
The board of New Jersey Transit approved a $1.14 billion budget for its commuter rail and bus lines for 2002 this past July, up $138 million from last year. The amount reflected state assistance to the agency, which was only one-third of the increased aid it had sought. This capped years in which federal operating assistance was virtually eliminated and state assistance was cut as well.
Kristen Fountain, spokeswoman for the Tristate Transportation Campaign, a regional mass transit advocacy group, said that there had been a "disconnect" between the long-term planning on mass transit needs and providing the operating money needed each year.
New Jersey transportation officials, she said, had embarked on ever-more ambitious plans, with the hope from year to year that their operating budgets would be increased to keep up with the pace.
"We need leaders who can bring the two processes together," she said of the long-term planning and the annual budget cycle. "It is one of the main things that the administration of Governor-elect James McGreevey ought to be focusing on, and maybe this study will help."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE RED CROSS; 
Red Cross Pledges Entire Terror Fund To Sept. 11 Victims

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES and DAVID BARSTOW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
The American Red Cross, humbled by weeks of scathing criticism, announced today that it would use its $543 million Liberty Disaster Fund only to assist the people affected by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, a decision that guarantees families hundreds of millions of dollars in additional charitable aid.
 The announcement is a sharp departure from the organization's original plans to steer more than $200 million of the Liberty fund donations into a reserve fund for potential future terrorist attacks and to use millions more for programs aimed at improving its own readiness for such attacks. 
 The reserve fund had provoked intense criticism from victim families and lawmakers, who accused the agency of misleading many of its donors about how their money would be spent. Only last weekend, the agency offered refunds to any disgruntled donors. 
But today, it went even further, promising not to use any of the Liberty fund for things like a $50 million blood reserve program and community outreach efforts. Instead, it vowed to spend at least half the fund, or $275 million, on cash grants and services to affected families by Dec. 31, and to announce its plans for the rest of the money in January.
"The people of this country have given the Red Cross their hard-earned dollars, their trust and very clear direction for our Sept. 11 relief efforts," said David T. McLaughlin, chairman of the agency's board of governors, at a news conference. "Regrettably, it took us too long to hear their message. Now we must change course to restore the faith of our donors and the trust of Americans."
As part of the changes announced today, the Red Cross will now cover a full year's worth of living expenses for the affected families -- from the four terrorist-led airplane crashes at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon and in western Pennsylvania -- through its "family gift" cash-grant program, which was originally limited to three months of aid. That program, which has already distributed more than $47 million, will deliver an additional $111 million in cash gifts to families by January, the agency said.
The Red Cross also said that it will use some of the Liberty donations to hire more than 200 case workers to help families navigate the maze of charities that are trying to assist victims.
And finally, the agency said that it will use the interest earned on the Liberty fund to cover as many of the administrative expenses as possible. Agency officials estimated that fewer than 10 cents of every donated dollar will be spent on overhead.
"We deeply regret that our activities over the past eight weeks have not been as sharply focused as America wants, nor as focused as the victims of this tragedy deserve," said Harold Decker, who replaced Dr. Bernadine Healy two weeks ago as the chief executive of the disaster relief agency.
Mr. Decker also ended more than six weeks of confusion by committing the agency to cooperate with efforts to build a database of victims who have received charitable help, first proposed 10 days after the attacks by New York Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, with the backing of most of the major charities responding to the terrorist attacks.
When the database was first announced, Dr. Healy rejected it as an invasion of privacy. Mr. Decker said he thought the database would help coordinate long-term help for families. Dr. Healy did not respond to a telephone message left at her office today.
Mr. Spitzer called today's announcement "a monumental step forward."
Mr. Spitzer, whose office regulates charities in the state, said he had been pressuring the Red Cross for weeks to change its plans for the Liberty fund. But at first, he said officials seemed impervious to his argument that the agency was effectively defying the wishes of donors.
He eventually told the relief agency that he was prepared to take legal action against it over its plans for the Liberty fund, Mr. Spitzer said. "What had been a misstep of some magnitude has now been corrected," he added.
The Liberty fund's new direction was also greeted enthusiastically by members of Congress, some of whom have been critical of the agency's previous plans.
Only last week, senior Red Cross officials were criticized by members of Congress and legislators in New York who accused the agency of cynically using the Sept. 11 tragedies to address long-term fund-raising goals and of siphoning tens of millions of dollars from widows and children.
But today, some of the same lawmakers who criticized the Red Cross last week attended the agency's news conference to express their support for the new deployment of the Liberty fund.
Representative Charles Bass, a Republican from New Hampshire and a longtime Red Cross supporter, called last week's hearings painful and commended the agency for moving "to respond to, clearly, what was the American will."
Families of those killed on Sept. 11 approved of today's announcement, too. "Now at least we know we're O.K. for a year," said Liz McLaughlin, a widow from Pelham, N.Y., who had offered emotional testimony on the subject before Congress last week.
As the Liberty fund's work moves from emergency relief to more long-term assistance, Mr. Decker said that his legal staff will be working closely with other charities and with Congress to clarify the Internal Revenue Service rules that apply to tax-exempt agencies to ensure that the relief effort is not impeded.
Under I.R.S. rules, tax-exempt charities are required to base their distributions on financial need, which in the past has been defined as an inability to afford the basic necessities of life.
Although Mr. Decker said that several hundred families who were offered help by the Red Cross have declined, because their own resources are adequate, many of the other families who have received aid are more affluent than the traditional I.R.S. definition seems to envision. This has stymied some richly endowed charities that planned to make large cash grants, across the board, to the families of firefighters and other uniformed personnel who died in the trade center twin towers' collapse.
The emergency assistance that is the traditional focus of the Red Cross is generally exempt from the neediness standards of the I.R.S., which noted that even affluent families may be left temporarily needy by floods, fires or other disasters. And the Red Cross hoped that by using case workers trained in assessing family needs, it can satisfy the I.R.S. standards going forward, said A. Frank Donoghue, the chief executive of the Red Cross's southeastern Pennsylvania chapter in Philadelphia.
Last week, as part of legislation to stimulate the economy, the Senate Finance Committee adopted a measure that would expand how charities could define financial need. The point, said a Republican staff member on the committee, was to avoid criticizing charities for not distributing donations to the victims of Sept. 11 while also tying their hands with the red tape of I.R.S. regulations.
"We're not going to put them in a hard spot," the staff member said.

Moving Fast, With Anchor
DAN RATHER says a Philadelphia taxi driver who handled the wheel "like a Nascar driver" rushed him from the airport to the train station when his New York-bound flight was rerouted after the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 on Monday.
 Mr. Rather was on an American Airlines flight from Austin, Tex., that landed in Philadelphia around noon. The taxi driver made the seven-mile trip to the train station "in a flat 14 minutes," Mr. Rather said. "All I'm going to say is I put him on the incentive system." He would not say how much he had paid the driver, adding that he did not know the man's name. 
 Mr. Rather said he learned of the crash in New York from an inside source -- the pilot of his plane, who sent him a note before making an announcement on the public address system. "The note said, 'I'm not authorized to tell everybody this at this moment, but as a courtesy I want you to know,' " Mr. Rather said. "The flight attendant who handed it to me said, 'If you can keep this to yourself at this moment, we'd appreciate it.' I did. I didn't even call my office immediately." The pilot "laid out the facts" of the crash on the public address system a short time later, Mr. Rather said. Later the pilot said the plane would go to Nashville, then Baltimore, then Philadelphia.
Mr. Rather had arranged for a reservation on the train, and after dashing through the airport, he climbed into the cab, telling the driver there was not a moment to waste. "He took off very quickly, sort of jerked my head back," Mr. Rather recalled. "He said, 'Don't you worry, Mr. Rather.' I was in the chair" -- at CBS News in Manhattan -- "shortly after 2 p.m."

A News Star May Dim
The public-television types have the tin cup out, as they so often do. This time it is DALJIT DHALIWAL who will get the hook unless someone puts something in the cup, and more than pennies. WNET-TV says that for lack of $300,000 or so, it is dropping Ms. Dhaliwal, the British anchor whose fans range from DAVID LETTERMAN to autograph-seeking waiters at the Four Seasons restaurant.
WNET, which has distributed her nightly program since October 1998, has told 60 stations around the country that carry her "ITN World News" that it will stop supplying the program at the end of the year. Unless, of course, some money turns up.
WARD CHAMBERLAIN, a vice president of WNET, said that the program's principal underwriter, Virgin Atlantic Airways, had cut back on its contribution. "We're $300,000 or $400,000 short," he said.
JOHN C. RIORDAN, a vice president of Virgin Atlantic, said the airline had always expected WNET to find a second underwriter. He said he was disappointed that it had not done so, adding, "Airline economics have changed."

Interested in Fashion? Sure
"I've never been to a lingerie fashion show," SIGOURNEY WEAVER said on her way to her seat in a tent in Bryant Park, where Victoria's Secret models were about to show off the company's merchandise. "I think it will be great theater, especially for my husband," she added, flashing a glance at her husband, JIM SIMPSON. Joining them in the crowd were MACAULAY CULKIN, ALAN CUMMING, RUSSELL SIMMONS, MARK WAHLBERG and REGIS and JOY PHILBIN.
"This is a special favor for Regis," Mrs. Philbin said. "He very rarely really, really wants to go to something. But he really wanted to go to this. So I figured he must be shopping for me for Christmas."

HEADLINE: Sales Tax, Key to Budget, Plunges in Nassau 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Nov. 14 

 BODY:
As Nassau County's top officials prepare to meet Thursday to try to patch together a budget that could avoid a state takeover, they are facing a major hurdle: the county's biggest revenue source is its sales tax, and no one is sure how badly it has eroded or when it might recover.
 The latest tax collections showed a scary plunge. Receipts for September skidded 16.9 percent compared with the prior year's figure, according to the State Department of Taxation and Finance. And in October, receipts were still down 8.8 percent from a year earlier. 
 "The sales tax is key to the budget, and these last two months were certainly the steepest declines seen in recent memory," said Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a group of business, labor and civic leaders. "The direction is certainly down, and down significantly." Nassau was especially affected by terrorist attacks in New York City because it is an adjoining county with many commuters who work in Manhattan and at the airports in Queens and in related businesses, Dr. Kamer said.
In the latest draft of the county's $2.2 billion budget for next year, the sales tax is projected to yield $851 million, nearly 40 percent of the total. It dwarfs any other revenue, including the property tax, fees and state and federal aid. But now no one knows for sure what the county sales tax, which is 4.5 percent, will actually produce.
The calculations are complicated by the effects of the World Trade Center calamity, the anthrax attacks, the plane crash on Monday, stock market gyrations, growing unemployment and the threat of regional, national and global recessions.
"Consumer psychology is hard to predict, and we have more uncertainties than before, a number of imponderables," Dr. Kamer said. "There's a lot of downside risk to any forecast today." Her projection is that sales will recover modestly, especially in the second half of next year, reaching an overall annual average of a 2.5 to 3 percent increase.
A deadline of Nov. 28 looms for the county to close what state monitors say are gaps of up to $45 million in the budget originally proposed by the retiring county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, and revised by the County Legislature.
The opening talks on Thursday will bring the Legislature's majority and minority leaders and Mr. Gulotta together with the head of the state-appointed oversight board, Frank G. Zarb, chairman of the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority.
"What's happening with the sales tax is one thing we'll be talking about, what we can or can't assume for next year," said the Legislature's presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat.
Her party is pushing for some combination of spending cuts and revenue increases above the 5 percent property tax increase already built into the budget.
But Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, has resisted tax increases in the past, and the Republican minority in the Legislature also favors spending cuts over more taxes.
Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for the minority leader, Peter Schmitt, has called on Mr. Gulotta to save money by wringing concessions from the county labor unions, to avoid a state takeover of the county's finances. "You can't tax your way out of this problem," Mr. Lazaro said. He also warned against "fudging the sales tax numbers." Critics have said that Mr. Gulotta's optimistic sales tax projections in the past were a prime cause of the big deficits that ultimately required a state bailout and the special oversight board.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: SECURITY COSTS; 
Additional Budget Cuts As States and Cities Address Safety Issues

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DENVER, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks are leaving a hefty financial bill with state and local governments, forcing them to pay for immediate security needs that were once only vaguely contemplated.
 From small towns like Red Wing, Minn., which is sharing weekly costs of $160 for a full-time guard at the local nuclear plant, to cities like Baltimore, where new security costs have reached $3.97 million since the attacks, government officials are taking a hard look at their budgets to figure out how to pay for efforts now deemed essential to homeland defense without layoffs and program cuts. 
 The National Governors' Association estimates that over the next six months, the post-Sept. 11 expenses could total as much as $10 billion in the 50 states. This is in addition to earlier projections of budget shortfalls totaling $15 billion due to the flagging economy and rising Medicaid costs. 
The total impact represents as much as 3 percent of a given state budget. 
"This makes a very bad situation catastrophic," Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the governors association, said of costs related to homeland security. "Most states have already done two to three rounds of budget cuts. Now they're preparing to do more and praying that the economy turns around."
For more than two months now, states and local governments have taken on the additional responsibilities to guard important buildings, improve airport security, protect water supplies, test for anthrax and pay the soaring overtime costs of police, firefighters and other emergency workers. 
"So far as I can see, everybody is reprioritizing and refocusing," said Larry Kallenberger, executive director of Colorado Counties Inc., a public policy group.
No state has been immune to new security needs since the attacks. Acting Gov. Jane M. Swift of Massachusetts authorized spending $26 million for terrorism-related efforts, including overtime for state police. The Ohio State Highway Patrol needs $800,000 over the next six months for increased security and inspections. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has approved spending $12 million for personnel and programs to handle biological and chemical attacks.
In Missouri, Gov. Bob Holden protected education and law enforcement programs when he cut $400 million from the budget earlier this year. Now, costs related to the terrorist attacks have raised the possibility of more cuts, "and in the next round," said Mr. Holden's spokesman, Jerry Nachtigal, "those areas may not escape unscathed."
While New York City, in particular, faces costs in the billions of dollars, other cities and counties, whose fire and police departments and emergency medical personnel are often the first line of defense, have their own problems.
A recent survey by the National League of Cities found that the impact of the attacks on local employment and tourism could lead to a 4 percent decline in revenues for cities, the equivalent loss of $11.4 billion. More than half the 214 cities surveyed in late October said they increased spending on security after Sept. 11 and they would offset the spending by dipping into surpluses and cutting other programs.
"We are hurting," said Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans, president of the United States Conference of Mayors. "Against the backdrop of seven to eight years of prosperity, low crime rates and low unemployment, all of a sudden -- bam -- Sept. 11 hits, and our revenues have been affected."
In New Orleans, Mayor Morial said, sales tax revenues plummeted 11 percent in September, which has forced a hiring freeze in city government and cutbacks in a variety of programs. Security costs for the city and the New Orleans airport, he said, have dug a $10 million budget gap.
In Baltimore, Mayor Martin O'Malley said city budget officials estimated that security costs could reach $15.8 million for the fiscal year.
"I've told all my agencies to sharpen their pencils and make recommendations of how to close the gap," Mayor O'Malley said. "But we could still face layoffs in January unless the economy turns around and the federal government acts quickly to help us."
Security costs in Dallas have passed $2 million and could reach $6 million by the end of the year, said Lois Finkelman, a City Council member. City officials have already begun inspecting budgets and searching for security companies to help ease police overtime costs. 
Other big cities have similar concerns, but most cities have a wide enough tax base to provide local leaders with room to spread the budget-cutting pain. That is not necessarily the case in rural areas, where many of the emergency services are performed by volunteers and where local leaders have to find clever ways to meet security needs.
In Red Wing, a town 50 miles south of Minneapolis, the need to post a guard at the road leading to the Prairie Island nuclear plant was solved by the plant management company assuming most of the costs, leaving the remainder to the city and to Goodhue County.
The solution -- city and county each contributing $80 a week -- seems reasonable, but the need to post a guard occupies one of Sheriff Dean Albers's 42 deputies for half a day, every day, at a time when the department has been told to step up its vigilance by "watching for suspicious low-flying planes and strange-looking people in the wrong place," as Sheriff Albers said.
"The whole thing adds more and more to our daily workload," he said. "Now, if we get a call that someone's mailbox has been damaged by vandals, it's not going to get handled."
The governors association and the mayors conference have lobbied Washington for help, asking for immediate reimbursements as well as access to long-term assistance through federal grants. At least one version of the economic stimulus package that Congress is now debating, a proposal from Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, would provide $6.3 billion for state and local efforts. 
But some places are not waiting for the federal government to act. Colorado and Illinois are debating the idea of using revenue from the state lottery to offset defense costs. And as a sign that virtually no area has escaped the impact of the terrorist attacks, officials in Catron County, N.M., who normally provide annual flu shots for local senior citizens at no cost, have been told that the sudden demand for flu shots amid the anthrax scare around the country means that the county will now have to pay $8.95 a shot.
With at least 150 people in need of the shots, said Jan Porter, the county treasurer, the cost could approach $1,500. But rather than use county money, Ms. Porter said, local residents are prepared act on their own.
"We hold a lot of fund-raisers when we have to," she said. "I suppose this time, we'll raise the money with an arts and crafts fair or maybe a bake sale."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: AVIATION SECURITY; 
Security Firms Ever Mindful To Cut Costs

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL MOSS and LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
International Total Services Inc. had been faltering for years. The company, which screens passengers at major airports nationwide, was running out of money. 
 I.T.S., as it is known, paid so little that it could scarcely hire enough workers, and those it did hire quickly left. At one airport, when its army of 90 screeners had slipped to 60, the company had raised salaries by more than a third to attract workers. But then it started losing $80,000 a month on that one job alone. 
 After slashing costs, dumping contracts, and borrowing all the money he could, the company's president, Mark D. Thompson, was in the Midtown Manhattan offices of his lawyer preparing to file for bankruptcy on the morning of Sept. 11. 
With Congress locked in yet another round of debates over airport security in the wake of the terrorist attacks, the fortunes of I.T.S., one of the largest companies in the industry, illustrate how difficult it will be to reinvent a system that has long treated airline security as an amenity rather than a necessity.
When passenger screening began in earnest in 1973, the government left security in the hands of the airlines. But the carriers saw it as a money-losing proposition and turned the chore over to private companies. Since then, in the brutal economics of airline deregulation, the airlines have sought to cut the cost of security by giving contracts to the lowest bidders, even if those companies have minimal or spotty records. 
Cost cutting was so deeply ingrained that even as the government scrambled to tighten security after Sept. 11, some airlines called on their screening companies to slash costs by 15 percent, according to Kenneth P. Quinn, a former chief counsel of the Federal Aviation Administration who now lobbies for security firms.
For their part, the companies have often accepted money-losing screening contracts in hopes of winning more lucrative airport work, such as baggage handling. Many then cut corners in hiring and training their screeners, paying them minimal wages that led to high turnover and low morale, industry experts say.
This economic conundrum is at the center of the debate in Washington about overhauling air security, with the House and Senate at odds over whether federal workers or private companies should perform the bulk of the screening work. But the record of airline security makes clear that, whoever is doing the screening, important questions remain. 
Even with the higher pay that Congress is now considering, the industry will need to attract, train and hold onto people who can effectively perform the vital, if monotonous, task of looking for weapons that are almost never there.
And the government will have to do something it has never managed to do before: maintain a focus on security even after the crisis has passed. 
"There is enough guilt to go all around on this," said Douglas R. Laird, former director of security for Northwest Airlines and now an aviation security consultant. "Everybody has some of it on their shoes."

Shifting Safety Concerns
When Trans World Airlines Flight 800 exploded off Long Island in 1996, a commission headed by Vice President Al Gore rushed to overhaul airline security, fearing the jet had been blown apart by a bomb. 
But when evidence pointed to a faulty fuel system, the government's focus shifted to aircraft safety improvements, and the passenger-screening changes lost momentum.
Five years later, the F.A.A. was just getting around to adopting one of the panel's key recommendations -- that the agency assume direct oversight of the security firms -- when the Sept. 11 attacks occurred. 
"We had planned an announcement the next week," said Rebecca Trexler, an agency spokeswoman. "I had posters, pictures, a press release."
From the first, airport security has been an on-again, off-again imperative.
Screening began after a rash of hijackings in the late 1960's and early 70's. First federal marshals screened passengers, but only those who fit hijacker profiles. In 1973, screening began full force as every passenger was required to pass through a metal detector and place carry-on baggage on an X-ray machine.
The airlines insisted on controlling the process -- whether they were doing the screening themselves or hiring others -- and the federal government did not question the arrangement.
One former F.A.A. security chief, Billie H. Vincent, said the system appeared to work fairly well until 1982, when a bomb exploded aboard a Pan Am flight from Tokyo to Honolulu, killing one person. Security concerns increased, he said, but even so, through the early 1980's some airlines balked when he called to recommend security precautions in response to intelligence about specific terrorist threats.
"I would issue emergency orders the next day," he recalled. 
After the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, a safety panel recommended that all screening employees be checked for criminal records. But at a time before computerized fingerprint analysis, the airlines successfully fought the move, arguing that the checks would take too long and cost too much.
To plead their case before Congress, the airlines hired William H. Webster, the former head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who called the background checks "a feckless gesture." 
While it is not known if such checks would have prevented the events of Sept. 11, Mr. Webster said recently, "We may have to go beyond what seemed reasonable at the time."
At the F.A.A., Ms. Trexler said her agency had been actively pursuing a number of security initiatives in the wake of Flight 800. Among them is a program to test the ability of screeners to detect weapons concealed in luggage. 
"It's the nature of the government that we can't do things suddenly," she said. "It's a long, deliberative process." 

Fierce Lobbying for Jobs
One of the early leaders in passenger screening was Wackenhut, the Florida-based security giant that guards nuclear power plants, prisoners, corporate executives and much more. Until the early 1990's, the company also had contracts at about 70 airports, but then smaller companies began edging it out of the business.
"The airlines kept lowering their prices and in most cases taking the low bidder, and we started losing contracts, one after another," said Patrick Cannan, a company spokesman.
Lobbying for the contracts became fierce. Michael B. Cantor, a consultant who worked in the mid-1990's for Argenbright, at the time a small but growing security firm, described how the company once courted United Airlines in Chicago. "We had dinner at a steakhouse, and there were maybe 20 or 30 guys," he recalled. "I looked at all the beefsteak on the table and thought, 'All the cows that gave their lives for this one contract is incredible.' "
Frank A. Argenbright Jr., the company founder, strove to distinguish his company in a highly competitive market in which the product all looked the same, Mr. Cantor said. When the Super Bowl came to Atlanta, where the company was based, "Frank had someone go out on the street and buy tickets at any price, for the airline guys," Mr. Cantor said.
In successfully vying for United's security work, Mr. Argenbright considered another approach, Mr. Cantor said. "He wanted to send them a check for $100,000 and say, 'If we do a bad job, you can cash this as part of the money for a transition to another company.' I said don't do it. It's nothing illegal but it would make everybody uncomfortable."
A spokeswoman for Mr. Argenbright said he had considered that plan but never carried it out.
Often, companies did not see the passenger screening contract as the prize. It was just a way to get their foot in the door for other airport work. Sky cap, or wheel chair handling contracts typically paid more.
Mr. Laird, the security consultant, described a chain of events he said became common. "If it takes 100 screeners to do a job, you'd bid it as if you were providing 97," he said. "Then you'd really staff it at 93 and hope you didn't get caught. That was the game played."
When security companies asked to get paid more, Mr. Laird said, "the airlines would never budge on the money and the product kept going down, down, down."
The F.A.A. uncovered thousands of breaches in security during the 1990's and issued millions of dollars in fines to the airlines. But industry officials say those fines were often greatly reduced through negotiation, if they were collected at all.
Last year, the F.A.A. fined T.W.A. $126,750 when its security firm allegedly failed to check the backgrounds of several dozen workers. But then T.W.A. went bankrupt. "We're still owed," said Ms. Trexler, the F.A.A. spokeswoman.
This should be a great time for International Total Services, which counts LaGuardia Airport among the major airports it serves. Of the four largest security companies, I.T.S. was the only one not involved in screening any of the Sept. 11 hijackers in Boston, Newark or Washington. It is also the only one that is still United States-owned, a potential advantage at a time of concern over national security.
But I.T.S. filed for bankruptcy reorganization on Sept. 13, driven to the brink of collapse not by terrorism but by the precarious economics of the airport security industry.
The company was founded in Cleveland 1978 by a group including Robert A. Weitzel, an aviation security specialist who in 1987 became the company's president.
Its explosive growth began in 1997 when the company sold stock to the public, raising $27 million. I.T.S. planned to buy mom-and-pop security and aviation-service companies across the country.
Such consolidations were a fad on Wall Street at the time and this one seemed to make sense. Airlines were increasingly contracting out everything from security screening to Skycaps and cabin cleaning, and they preferred to deal with a few big suppliers rather than many small ones.

A Company in Turmoil
But there were risks. The company had lost money as recently as 1994, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Passenger screening, in particular, was a low-profit business -- there was not much money left over after paying workers and buying equipment and uniforms. Employee turnover was about 100 percent.
Nevertheless, I.T.S. was a hit on Wall Street, where its share price soon doubled. The company spent almost $40 million (much of it borrowed from banks) in 21 months to buy the assets of 19 companies.
But most of what it bought were contracts, some of which were unprofitable and all of which could be canceled on short notice. Many of them were. Ultimately, the company wrote off $29 million of the acquisitions as worthless.
Like its competitors, I.T.S. found itself squashed between the demands for cost-cutting by airlines and the pressures of an economy with very low unemployment. "From an operational standpoint, we are all in the same leaky rowboat," said Michael F. Sosh, the company's chief financial officer. "We have the same employee pool, the same wage scale."
For example, in August 1999, I.T.S. was only able to hire 60 of the 90 people it needed at one airport, where it was offering just 10 percent above minimum wage, according to testimony it submitted to the Department of Transportation.
Worried that it would get in trouble with the F.A.A., I.T.S. raised the pay rate by 36 percent. Hiring increased, turnover plunged, screening improved. But the company began losing $80,000 a month on that contract.
As the company's finances worsened, accounting problems led Nasdaq to delist its stock in 1999. Almost a year later, when it finally reported its financial results to the S.E.C., they were terrible. Company officials had told shareholders that it had earned $1 million in fiscal 1999. In fact, the company had actually lost $7.3 million.
In a lawsuit filed Sept. 18, the company put the blame for its troubles squarely on Mr. Weitzel, who had retired in late 1999. As far back as 1995, the company alleges, Mr. Weitzel underpaid workers compensation premiums by $2.6 million, made accounting errors, and interfered with the company's efforts to sell itself.
Mr. Weitzel denies the allegations. As far as the accounting goes, "His response is that he used the correct standards, and the professional people he hired used them," said his lawyer, Jonathon M. Yarger.
Meanwhile, I.T.S.'s main business suddenly has prospects of making money, said John W. Demell, who runs the company's aviation operations. After Sept. 11, he said, "There's a different attitude about what customers are willing to spend for security."
As Congress continues to debate air travel security, there is still trouble at the gates.
Although airport managers typically play no role in picking security firms, after Sept. 11, David Krietor, who runs Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, felt he had to take drastic action.
On the day air travel resumed after the attacks, a flight crew was allowed through security with a knife and a corkscrew. Then federal prosecutors alleged that Argenbright, which ran the Sky Harbor checkpoint, had hired workers around the country, including some in Phoenix, without checking for criminal records.
The airlines refused Mr. Krietor's request to switch security firms. So on Oct. 12 he took the unusual step of revoking the security company's permit to work at the airport.
Even that didn't work. The airlines have pleaded for more time. Argenbright, which says it has made numerous improvements nationwide, is still screening passengers in Phoenix. And three more security breaches have forced Mr. Krietor to empty entire terminal concourses so every last person -- most already jittery about flying -- could pass through metal detectors again.
"It's immensely frustrating," Mr. Krietor said. "I have virtually no control."
The question of who will control airport security is at the center of the agenda in Washington.
The authors of a bill passed unanimously by the Senate, including Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, the ranking Republican on the panel, argued that passengers would only feel safe on airplanes again if security was handled by law enforcement officers employed by the Justice Department. They argue that federal employees would be better paid than private workers and less likely to leave the job after a short time.
But House Republicans, led by Representatives Tom DeLay, the majority whip, and Dick Armey, the majority leader, say that increasing the federal work force by 28,000 -- the anticipated number of passenger screeners -- is unnecessary.
The House plan calls for the Department of Transportation to set strict standards, supervise and train the screeners, who would be privately employed. Civil service laws, House Republicans say, are to cumbersome and inflexible to get the job done. They also point out that in Europe, frequently, these same private security companies do a much better job because they are strictly regulated by the government.
Regardless of what shape the new system takes, finding the right people to do the job will remain the biggest challenge. Rising unemployment may help. But Amie Powell, for one, won't be signing up.
Ms. Powell liked her stint at an Argenbright checkpoint at Denver International Airport several years ago. But then she left it for a job as a waitress at the Chuckwagon Cafe.
Now she's back in the market for a new job, but she hasn't given a second thought to Argenbright's help wanted ads. Even with the prospect of better pay, she now has new concerns. "With all of the terrorism going on," she said, "it would be just too stressful."

FORD IS EXTENDING INTEREST-FREE-LOAN INCENTIVES

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it had extended its interest-free loans on cars and trucks until Jan. 14, following its larger rival, the General Motors Corporation, on incentives that spurred record sales last month. Ford will offer the no-interest loans on all models except the Thunderbird car and Escape sport utility vehicle, said a spokeswoman, Susan Krusel. 
Even as Ford extended the offer, its chairman and chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., told a business group in Kansas City, Mo.: "Maybe the first part of next year isn't going to be great for us. There is going to be a payback. Ultimately, we have to find a way to wean ourselves off this." Ford's shares fell 9 cents, to $16.34. The stock has declined 30 percent this year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Companies Largely Back Trade Decisions 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
With some notable caveats, many American companies yesterday endorsed the World Trade Organization's new rules for negotiating a trade agreement, arguing that the potential for increased exports outweighs the damage a few industries might suffer.
 "We view the new round of negotiations authorized at the W.T.O. meeting as a hunting license for bringing down tariffs," said Franklin J. Vargo, an international trade expert with the National Association of Manufacturers. 
 The agreement reached yesterday by more than 140 trade ministers gathered in Doha, Qatar, sets the rules for a new round of tariff-lowering trade negotiations. 
There were dangers for some industries. Pharmaceutical companies objected to provisions that might weaken patent protection for drugs. Steel producers saw a risk that America's antidumping laws could be diluted. The textile industry worried that too much ground might have been given to foreign competitors.
Tariffs worldwide average 12 percent, down from 15 percent as a result of the Uruguay trade agreement in 1994. And now there is the promise of fresh tariff reductions.
"We will seek free trade in everything from digital cameras to black-and-white film," the Eastman Kodak Company said, "with the aim of cutting our tariff costs of nearly $200 million a year."

Agreement on Medicines

BYLINE:  By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
The agreement on medicines brokered in Qatar makes it clear that poor countries can make generic versions of expensive brand name drugs for the treatment of AIDS and other serious epidemics -- a situation that the big drug companies have long sought to avoid.
 Some analysts and activists say that the new trade declaration could apply to almost any medicine that a country needs, including those that treat diseases like asthma, diabetes, cancer and heart disease. 
 But yesterday, the drug companies played down the significance of the declaration, which is intended to clarify an existing global agreement on patents. Gwen Fisher, a spokeswoman for Merck, said, "This does not change the way we sell our medicines." 
Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the brand name industry's Washington trade group, said: "We do not believe that our intellectual property rights are in any way diminished. We're satisfied with the language." He said he believed that the agreement applied only to highly contagious and devastating diseases and not to chronic illnesses.
Earlier, however, on Monday, Mr. Holmer had sent a letter to Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, warning that any compromise should not weaken the drug industry's patent rights.
James Love, the director of the Consumer Project on Technology, an organization that works to improve access to medicines, argued that the new declaration could be used to help lower the price of drugs and other health care products in all countries.
"This goes beyond AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis," Mr. Love said. "Any health care item could be included. We want to use this in the United States, in Germany and in Switzerland." 
Even before the declaration, poor countries had the right to make copycat versions of a brand name medicine in the event of a health emergency by issuing what is called a compulsory license. But no country has done so, in part because of fears about trade sanctions. Yesterday's declaration makes it clear that each country has a right to grant compulsory licenses and to determine what constitutes a health emergency.
Richard T. Evans, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said that the declaration would help to legitimize the business of making copycat versions of brand name drugs in many developing countries, and some companies will probably never be able to make money in those countries. "We can write off the developing countries," he said, "as a long-term source of profits." MELODY PETERSEN

Agricultural Trade

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
American agriculture officials said they were pleased with the outcome of W.T.O. meetings because it meant members of the group were prepared to move toward reductions of tariffs and other barriers to agricultural trade.
 The United States, the largest exporter of agricultural goods, has long been frustrated by high tariffs and other trade barriers in Europe, the Pacific Rim and elsewhere. 
While American farmers are highly subsidized for production at home, they get less export assistance than farmers in many other countries and the United States does not impose high duties on agricultural imports. 
 "This will give American farmers greater access to world markets," said Tim Hume, head of the National Corn Growers Association. "It's important because agriculture products face an average of 60 percent tariffs abroad."
The talks in Qatar do not signal a clear victory for United States agriculture because they are only the beginning of a process. They do, however, indicate that member countries would like to move toward a more liberal and open marketplace for food. Some companies are likely to be particularly big beneficiaries of trade liberalization in agriculture: Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, the grain exporters, and Tyson Foods and Smithfield Foods, meat producers and processors. And farmers could see some higher prices. DAVID BARBOZA

HEADLINE: National Briefing Northwest: Washington: Unemployment Rate Climbs 

BYLINE:  By Matthew Preusch (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The state's unemployment rate climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 6.2 percent in October, state employment officials said, announcing the first figures to show the effects of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Economists say the increase in unemployment means the state is in a recession that could last into next year. The service sector was hit hardest, losing 7,800 jobs. Matthew Preusch (NYT)

HEADLINE: More Signs Of Downturn For Europe 

BYLINE:  ByEDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
They are not using the word recession yet, but some of Europe's biggest corporations provided new evidence today that a real downturn may come sooner rather than later.
 Siemens, the electronics conglomerate, reported today that it lost nearly $1 billion in the most recent quarter. Lufthansa, in many respects the strongest airline in Europe, said that air travel had been down about 22 percent since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and that it might well finish the year with a loss. And Allianz, the German insurance conglomerate, raised its estimate on the terrorist-related claims it will have to pay to 1.5 billion euros ($1.3 billion) from 1 billion euros. 
 As recently as last spring, many European companies thought they could dodge the economic downturn in the United States with only minor damage. That comfort had already largely evaporated by Sept. 11, but the anxiety unleashed by the terrorist attacks and the subsequent war in Afghanistan has had an impact on almost every sector.
In Germany, five economic institutes that advise the government released their most pessimistic forecasts yet for the nation, Europe's biggest economy, in the coming year. German growth, nearly nonexistent in recent months, will remain well below 1 percent next year as well.
Unemployment is rising across the Continent, while investment has declined sharply and consumer spending is anemic. Export growth has ground to a halt, even though the euro remains cheap compared with the dollar.
Siemens, with products as diverse as household appliances and nuclear power turbines, is suffering from steep declines in the demand for wireless telephones and networking systems. And because it still owns 51 percent of Infineon Technologies, its former chip-making subsidiary, the company has been badly hurt by plunging sales of memory chips for personal computers.
Siemens has announced plans to eliminate as many as 15,000 jobs worldwide. Infineon, where sales have fallen by nearly half in the last 12 months, is eliminating another 5,000 jobs. Rivals like Alcatel of France and Ericsson of Sweden are also cutting jobs by the thousands.
Heinrich von Pierer, the chief executive of Siemens, has already ordered a broad revamping of its businesses in telecommunication networks and mobile telephones. Siemens took write-offs and restructuring charges totaling 1 billion euros ($881 million) for the two units.
Investors greeted the Siemens report with relief, because most of the bad news was already known and Mr. von Pierer provided no new shocks. Siemens's stock climbed 7.6 percent, to 62.19 euros ($54.80).
But most European companies say it is still impossible to predict whether a real recovery will occur next year. Chemical producers like BASF have been hurt badly by plunging demand for chemicals used to make plastics. Vendors of luxury goods and high-fashion clothing have been hurt by consumer anxiety, particularly in the United States. Bulgari, the Italian manufacturer of luxury watches, suffered a 60 percent decline in its third-quarter profits and said sales had dropped significantly after Sept. 11.
Airlines and tourism companies are dealing with widespread fear of flying as well. Iberia, the Spanish airline, announced plans today to eliminate 2,500 jobs. That comes after the bankruptcies of Swissair and Sabena, and the growing threat that airlines from Ireland to Italy may collapse as well.
"Sept. 11 has changed the world," said Jurgen Weber, chief executive of Lufthansa, as he reported that profits had evaporated since then. "It has changed international air traffic more profoundly than any crisis before."
Lufthansa's profit in the nine months ended Sept. 30 were 290 million euros ($256 million), down 65 percent from the period a year earlier. Mr. Weber predicted that air traffic would remain depressed by about 22 percent at least through December, and analysts assume that the once-lucrative trans-Atlantic routes will be among the hardest hit.
For companies that already had problems of their own making, the situation is worse. Bayer, the chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate, reported today that it lost 183 million euros ($161 million) in the third quarter; for the period a year earlier it reported a profit of 534 million euros.
Bayer was hurt by plunging demand and prices for basic chemicals, but its drug business has suffered even more, chiefly because Bayer was forced to withdraw an anti-cholesterol drug after it was implicated in more than 50 deaths.
Bayer was one of the few companies to get something of a lift from recent events, because it makes Cipro for treating anthrax. But Cipro sales will provide only modest profits, because the United States government forced the company to sell it bulk supplies at less than one-quarter of the normal price.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Increase 7.1%, Mostly From Car Incentives 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Retail sales surged 7.1 percent in October, almost three times analysts' expectations, as consumers spent money at auto dealers, department and discount stores and building supply outlets.
 The increase, reported by the Commerce Department, followed a 2.2 percent decline in September. The report also showed that sales excluding a record increase in purchases at car dealerships rose only 1 percent, after falling 1.5 percent in September. The increase in vehicle sales was a result of no-interest financing offered by manufacturers. 
 Some economists, noting the incentives-driven increase in auto sales, said that the unemployment rate, now up to 5.4 percent, would restrain spending in the coming months. "A weak labor market and a need to repair balance sheets is going to weigh on the consumer for some time," said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez in New York.
Analysts had expected retail sales to increase 2.5 percent and sales excluding cars to rise 0.3 percent.
October's total increase was the largest since 1992, the earliest that figures are available under the Commerce Department's most recent method of tabulating sales. It switched to a new method of computing retail sales figures this year and revised the data back to February 1992. Using previous accounting methods, the October rise was the biggest since 1968.
Sales of cars, trucks and parts increased by a record 26.4 percent last month after falling 4.5 percent in September. As General Motors, Ford and other manufacturers drew buyers into showrooms with interest-free loans, sales jumped in October to a record 21.3 million units at an annual pace, exceeding the 21.2 million pace set in September 1986, industry figures showed.
The report "demonstrates the power of economic incentives," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. He added, "People told consumer surveys they were miserable, but they were willing to borrow money to pursue a bargain."
Sales at department and discount stores increased 0.7 percent after falling 0.5 percent in September. Those at clothing and accessory shops rose 6.9 percent last month after a 5.9 percent decrease in September.
Consumers patronized discounters last month in an effort to stretch their buying power. Sales at stores open at least a year were 6.7 percent higher in October than in the month a year earlier.
Sales of building material rose 2.8 percent in October, the biggest increase since April. Sales at stores offering sporting goods, books, music, electronics and appliances also rose.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
ALegal Eagle (His Ad Claims)

BYLINE:  By CRYSTAL NIX HINES 

 BODY:
In an increasingly competitive economic environment, a growing number of law firms are trying to create brand images that will set them apart from their competitors. To do so, they are developing sophisticated marketing campaigns complete with print, radio and television advertisements, even relying at times on kitschy slogans once commonly used to sell consumer goods.
 For example, Hale & Dorr, based in Boston, uses ads with fluorescent colors and the slogan, "When Success Matters." The ads proclaim the firm as counsel to innovators, visionaries and change agents. 
 In San Francisco, the law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe has built a campaign around the letter "O." An advertisement for its intellectual property litigation displays a green life raft in an O shape and tells clients to "grab hold of Orrick." Another, a globe with a cut-out circle, declares that "the global economy is an Orrick business." 
And in Winston-Salem, N.C., the firm Womble, Carlyle, Sandridge & Rice illustrates its slogan, "Our lawyers mean business," with a bulldog. The mascot, named Winston, has appeared on airport billboards, coffee cups, T-shirts and mouse pads. "Is it serious?" said Pressly M. Millen, a partner and the chairman of the client development committee at Womble Carlyle. "Of course not. But if the idea is to be noticed and get name recognition, it's certainly done that for us."
Law firms have wrestled with the ethical question of whether and how to advertise since the Supreme Court lifted the prohibition in 1977. For years, most of the advertising was sedate and passive, often confined to small notices in trade publications. But as competition for clients increased, some firms began to look for a new and more effective ways to attract clients. 
"I find some of the ads revolting in terms of taste and content," said William B. Dunn, a partner at the law firm Clark Hill in Detroit and special adviser to the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Ethics and Responsibility. "It's a shame if people are persuaded by some of those ads." He said that aside from some general prohibitions against false and misleading ads, there were few restrictions that state bar associations could place on advertising.
Although many firms have had marketing programs for years, only recently have some started to apply the techniques used by corporations and financial service firms to buff their images.
"Law firm advertising has really broken free," said Burkey Belser, president of Greenfield/Belser, a design firm in Washington that has helped more than 200 firms with advertising campaigns. "Law firms have gotten over the hurdle of whether it feels comfortable to advertise at all, and then once over that hurdle, are doing very creative advertising."
David R. Brink, a retired lawyer in Minneapolis and a past president of the American Bar Association, said that "as long as the ads are demonstrably true, they are probably all right from an ethical point of view."
"But from the point of view of taste," Mr. Brink said, "that's something else." He said that while the theory of advertising is sound, some lawyers "might regret the loss of more tasteful and seemingly genteel ways of yesteryear."
Experts say sophisticated advertisements, client forums and other marketing efforts are crucial in an environment in which firms must find ways to separate themselves from the competition.
"There might be 50 or 100 great firms," said Sylvia L. Coulter, marketing director at Hale & Dorr and president of the Legal Marketing Association, which has 1,500 members. "How do you tell which one to go to?"
For many firms, the answer, increasingly, is branding, with some firms trying to push the envelope to attract attention. A survey by the Legal Marketing Association found that half of all firms have recently conducted a branding campaign although most were relatively modest.
Womble, Carlyle was one of the first large firms to place billboards in airport kiosks, Mr. Millen said, and it took its bulldog campaign to the radio a few weeks ago.
Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison in San Francisco shocked the legal world this year by becoming the first nationwide firm to advertise on television, a forum traditionally reserved for personal injury lawyers. The firm's $3.5 million campaign included four 30-second commercials on the CNN cable network, with the computer graphics designed by the same company, Digital Domain, that produced them for the movies, "Titanic," "The Matrix" and "The Terminator," the law firm's marketing director, David Geyer, said.
"We think the early-mover advantage brings us this perception of being out front," Mr. Geyer said, "and it's my experience that clients want to work with firms that are out front on issues." 
On one of its television spots, an airplane stalls and descends toward the ocean. Then an oversized hand lifts it safely back toward the sky. On another, a train is speeding over a mountain pass and the giant hand reaches down to straighten the curves out of the track. Each spot ends with the firm's tagline, "Brobeck: When Your Future Is At Stake." The airplane ad was temporarily withdrawn after Sept. 11 and also after the jetliner crash in New York on Monday.
Mr. Geyer said that the advertisements "leave no impression we are chasing ambulances." He noted that when Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) became the first consulting agency tied to an accounting firm to advertise on television in the late 1980's, it was the fifth largest, while PriceWaterhouse was the leader. "Ten years later," he said, "their positions have reversed."
Mr. Geyer attributes part of the firm's growth to marketing efforts built around a strategy of "awareness, contact and closure."
According to The American Lawyer magazine, the firm has risen to the 14th largest in the nation -- with revenue last year of $476 million, a 52 percent increase over the previous year -- from the 33th largest in 1997, with $250 million in revenue. 
But others are skeptical that law firms will be able to create an effective brand image that will distinguish one from another.
"Marketing professionals in law firms have been led to believe that for a very modest investment, they can achieve the kind of 'brand' that is being achieved by the big accounting firms and other professional services firms," said Mark T. Greene, managing director of FGI Research, a marketing research company. "That's simply not going to happen for anything close to the marketing expenditures law firms have been making."
Mr. Greene noted that large corporations normally spend $100 million to $200 million on a marketing campaign for a product. Law firms generally spend about 2 percent of their gross revenues, and the average expenditure is about $136,000, according to the association's survey. Marketing costs for accounting firms average about 7 percent to 10 percent of gross revenue.
But Norm Rubenstein, chief marketing officer at Orrick, said that law firms could still achieve name recognition over time, despite modest budgets, by aiming at a smaller audience.
"Individuals who hire law firms are a less expansive universe than the entire buying public," Mr. Rubenstein said, "and the investment is different than it is for selling soap or Coca-Cola to every consumer in America."
Another obstacle, experts say, is the insistence of many firms on marketing themselves as "full-service law firms," rather than as leaders in particular fields.
"Law firms always want to be branded as a big firm with great lawyers and great work, but that doesn't get you anywhere," Mr. Greene said. "They haven't had the courage to say, 'Here's how we are different,' because doing that is in part saying what you are not. If you say you have the best intellectual property practice, the real estate lawyers are going to be upset."
Julie A. Eichorn, president of Paragon, a consulting firm for professional organizations in Austin, Tex., questioned whether clients are really looking for "one-stop shopping," and said firms needed to do a better job of identifying their expertise and "deciding which piece of the market they want."
Beyond expanding their marketing efforts, law firms have elevated the status of marketing directors, with some being called chief marketing officers and paid partner-level salaries. Many have been lured from consumer products companies and consulting, advertising and accounting firms. 
Mr. Geyer of Brobeck, who says he is in the middle range on the partner pay scale, had 15 years of advertising experience at J. Walter Thompson, as well as six years in Pricewaterhouse's marketing department.
Frederick J. Morsches, director of marketing at Foley, Hoag & Eliot in Boston, which has 240 lawyers, came from the card company Hallmark and the consulting firm of McKinsey & Company. Ms. Coulter of Hale & Dorr had nine years of sales experience at Wang Laboratories.
Although law firms are using differing strategies to emerge from the pack, the key, marketing directors and lawyers agree, is creativity.
"Our guiding principle was to try not to look like traditional law firm advertising -- which distinguishes itself in how boring it is," Mr. Millen said. "Firms can really overdo the stuffiness. The block-letter ads you see printed one after another in legal trade publications are a recipe for being ignored."

HEADLINE: New Horizons for CanWest 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: WINNIPEG, Manitoba 

 BODY:
You don't have to go far in Winnipeg to encounter the Aspers.
 The University of Manitoba has the I. H. Asper School of Business with its Asper Commemorative Room. The Asper Jewish Community Campus is home to a popular athletic club, two schools, a museum and a Holocaust center. The family has financed the Lyric Theater in a park adjoining the Assiniboine River, and the Manitoba Theater for Young People. Winnipeg's new ballpark is named for the Aspers' media company, the CanWest Global Communications Corporation. The Asper Foundation's offices are in the same downtown building as CanWest's headquarters. 
 The family's reach is becoming just as noticeable across the country, through the rapid growth of CanWest, which has shot up the rankings to become Canada's largest media company. In just the last two years, a spree of acquisitions has transformed what was once the smallest of the three national television networks into a sprawling empire of 16 television stations, 7 specialty channels, 26 daily newspapers and 120 community papers.
In the United States, CanWest has a partnership with the Tribune Company's Tribune Entertainment unit to produce and distribute television shows like "Mutant X" and "Andromeda." In Australia, CanWest controls Network Ten, one of the country's three privately owned networks, as well as its biggest billboard company. CanWest also has majority stakes in the No. 2 television station in Northern Ireland and in New Zealand's biggest radio network.
The company's revenues have more than doubled in two years, and its work force has grown tenfold, to 9,000 workers.
 The company reported on Wednesday that revenue reached 576 million Canadian dollars ($361.4 million) in the latest quarter, which ended Aug. 31. Operating income has grown rapidly as well, fueled by new acquisitions, but because of the cost of servicing debts taken on to make the acquisitions, the company said it had lost 37 million Canadian dollars ($23.2 million) for the quarter. 
Canada has a history of having international media barons emerge from the hinterlands. Lord Beaverbrook, who rose to own The Daily Express of Britain, grew up in New Brunswick. Lord Thomson of Fleet, the onetime proprietor of The Times of London, began at a radio station in North Bay, Ontario. More recently, Conrad Black, whose interests include the Telegraph group of Britain, The Chicago Sun-Times and The Jerusalem Post, started with a paper in rural Quebec.
The Aspers' horizons are no less ambitious. "Our objective is to create a lasting and unassailable worldwide media business," Leonard Asper, CanWest's chief executive, said in an interview.
Though its stock trades in New York and Toronto, CanWest remains a family business dominated by Israel H. Asper, Leonard's father and CanWest's chairman. The family controls 45 percent of CanWest's stock, and David Asper, Leonard's older brother, is also a senior executive. Their sister, Gail, is corporate secretary and runs the Asper Foundation. 
Israel Asper, known as Izzy, passed the chief executive title to Leonard two years ago. He has said he will give up his remaining official duties and his CanWest office next August when he turns 70, but few would be surprised if he continued to call the shots for years to come. "You have a certain moral authority when you're the founder," Leonard Asper, 37, said. 
Israel Asper, the son of Russia immigrants who operated a movie theater in tiny Minnedosa, Manitoba, built his career and his company in somewhat un-Canadian ways. Trained as a tax lawyer, he was frustrated in a political career after being elected to the provincial parliament. He started in the media business in 1975 by buying a small television station in Pembina, N.D., with three partners and moving it north to Winnipeg.
Now, in a country where the publicly financed Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is a dominant force, CanWest's Global TV network has carved out a profitable niche attracting advertisers to popular American-made programs. "They were great in assessing the hot new show," said Gordon Pitts, a Toronto journalist who is writing a book on Canada's media barons.
Too great, sometimes, for the liking of homegrown film producers, who have long complained of the difficulty of competing with Hollywood. When one called Mr. Asper and other private broadcasters "nothing but toll collectors between Canadians and their access to popular American shows," Mr. Asper sued, charging defamation; the case is pending.
CanWest bought more stations in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario last year, making it a national network. A few months later it snapped up the Southam chain of newspapers from Mr. Black's Hollinger group for $2.2 billion, including a half-interest in The National Post, a paper begun by Mr. Black in 1998 to challenge The Globe and Mail. CanWest took full control of The National Post earlier this year.
Naming Viacom and the Tribune Company as models, Leonard Asper said that having a spectrum of properties under one roof had advantages. "You can go to advertisers with a deeper and richer tapestry of information of how they can reach their customers," he said. There are also economies of scale, like a companywide call center in Winnipeg.
And the Aspers are not done acquiring: radio stations and a billboard operation in Canada are high on CanWest's shopping list. "We've decided to fortify home base," Israel Asper said, adding that once the Canadian portfolio was complete, "we'll return to the international arena."
Leonard Asper said expansion in the United States was "a logical progression," but the company views the American market with caution. "You have to be both well capitalized and have very strong partners to play in the U.S. sandbox," he said. "A bad deal can ruin the company."
Britain is also a potential target. CanWest submitted the highest bid for Britain's Channel 5 television network in 1995, but regulators rejected it because they were unhappy with the company's programming plans. 
Analysts have expressed growing concern that the Aspers have already bitten off more than they can easily chew. Because of last year's acquisitions, CanWest's debt was $3.02 billion on Aug. 31, compared with $367 million in August 1999. About one-fifth of that debt is in high-yield notes at 10.63 percent interest.
"Our No. 1 corporate priority is to reduce debt," Leonard Asper said. CanWest Global has suspended dividends to conserve cash, and it has eliminated 130 jobs at the money-losing National Post.
Robert Bek, a media analyst at CIBC World Markets in Toronto, describes CanWest's debt as "a nagging thing" but "very manageable" in relation to other media groups.
The Aspers' ambitions may be tempered by their deep roots in the Canadian prairies. Although Israel Asper owns an apartment in New York, he and his two sons and their families live within five doors of one another on Winnipeg's stately Wellington Crescent.

HEADLINE: Toys 'R' Us Thinks Big in Less Playful Time 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
With the economic downturn, the decline in tourism and forecasts of a dismal holiday season for retailers, it may be a risky moment to open a $35 million store, especially in a neighborhood that depends on out-of-towners for much of its foot traffic. But this Saturday, the giant retailer Toys "R" Us is planning to open what it calls the largest toy store in the world in Times Square.
 Once considered an ordeal for parents, with its unimaginative displays, crammed aisles and unhelpful salespeople, Toys "R" Us has been working hard in the last two years under its new chief executive to overhaul its image. 
 Starting Saturday, that effort will be put to its biggest test, as the company opens an airy new store in Times Square. At 110,000 square feet, it is big enough to accommodate a 60-foot-high Ferris wheel that children can actually ride, a five-ton dinosaur inspired by Jurassic Park and a 25-foot-tall replica of the Empire State Building, complete with King Kong. 
The new four-level store is on Broadway between 44th and 45th Streets, on the site of the Criterion movie theaters and Roundabout Theater. Once a seedy entertainment area, Times Square is now home to several prime office buildings, but it has only a handful of major retailers. A Warner Brothers studio store at 1 Times Square closed last month.
The opening comes at a time when the toy industry has been trying to cope with children's changing tastes and the difficulty in keeping up with demand for the most popular products. Manufacturers have also suffered from something that Chris Byrne, an independent toy consultant, describes as "age compression." These days, Mr. Byrne said, many children stop playing with toys when they turn 8, and many girls have outgrown Barbie dolls by 6.
Some retail experts, however, have predicted that toys will do well this season, because parents will want to indulge their children in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.
Many toy retailers do half their business during the Christmas holidays, which leads K. B. Toys, a mass retailer more commonly found in suburban malls, to open temporary K. B. Toys Express stores in vacant Manhattan space. This year K.B. is quietly slipping into half a dozen locations, including the former site of a Wolf Camera store on 86th Street near Lexington Avenue.
At Toys "R" Us, John H. Eyler, the chairman and chief executive, said he expected his new store, which will employ 700 people, to have a successful Christmas, with families from across the region taking the place of tourists. It is being marketed as the chain's flagship and as a kind of indoor theme park.
As a flagship, the new store will have a role beyond generating sales, said Sally H. Wallick, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker. "It's also there as a place to showcase new products and showcase the company in a new way," she said. Yesterday, even before the store had opened, Microsoft used it as a setting to introduce its new XBox video game system.
Formerly the nation's leading toy retailer, Toys "R" Us dropped into second place, behind Wal-Mart Stores, before Mr. Eyler was lured away from F.A.O. Schwarz. Since his arrival in January 2000, the company has spent $500 million to revamp 433 of its 1,583 stores, including its only other Manhattan store, at Union Square. A poorly performing Toys "R" Us at Herald Center on 34th Street closed in May.
The new store will epitomize the changes at the chain, Mr. Eyler said. "This is part of the long-term brand-building of our company," he said.
There will also be plenty of other brand-consciousness at the store, including the Pepsi Cafe. Each of the 14 cars on the Ferris wheel will promote a different toy or character, from Barbie to a Tonka Truck. Customers will also be bombarded by commercials from 45 video monitors throughout the store. 
In an arrangement that is commonplace in the cosmetics industry but is new in the toy business, some 25 manufacturers are sharing in the cost of displays like the two-story Barbie-doll town house.
Some toy industry experts expect the new Times Square store to steal some thunder from F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship Fifth Avenue store, which is half its size and is aimed at less cost-conscious tourists. Vendex, the company that owns F.A.O. Schwarz, recently announced that it was putting the toy retailer up for sale. 
But Mr. Byrne said there was no reason New York could not have both. "There's room for 'The Producers' and '42nd Street,' " he said. "Toys 'R' Us will not supplant the iconic role of F.A.O. Schwarz. It's a different experience."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY IN ART; 
Filmmakers Send a Message With Lego as the Medium

BYLINE:  By SARA IVRY 

 BODY:
LIKE many filmmakers, Rob Weychert has his ambitions. He used Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" in one film and he makes allusions to "Brave New World" in another. He adores the films of Todd Solondz, whom he calls "the modern master of black comedy." 
 "I don't know anybody else making films now that makes me simultaneously want to vomit and laugh hysterically," Mr. Weychert said of Mr. Solondz. "It would be neat to try with Lego." 
 That's right: Lego. The brightly colored plastic blocks that snap together to create all manner of shapes have inspired a niche world of filmmaking called brick films. Lego directors like Mr. Weychert use the traditional technique of stop-motion animation, shooting the film frame-by-frame and moving the figures between shots to create the illusion of motion. Some of their efforts are viewable online at brickfilms.com and in a special section of ifilm.com. 
Most works are from one to five minutes, enough time to satirize just about anything, and parodies of "Star Wars" and "2001: A Space Odyssey" are a staple of brick films. But there is a small group of auteurs, like Mr. Weychert, whose film work suggests a movement away from a fascination with novelty toward headier terrain. 
Jason Rowoldt, a computer consultant in Washington and the founder of brickfilms .com, acknowledged that, among the 40 or so filmmakers whose work is online, some do stand out. "Along with every 10 really juvenile directors," he said, "you get someone who really does a good job and wants to tackle things." 
Russ Jensen, a 21-year-old art student in central Michigan, addressed racism in his short "Black vs. Yellow." Two minifigs (Lego-speak for minifigure) declare their mutual unjustified hatred. A third comes along, chops them up in pieces and then reassembles them so that the two figures are now, in the Lego sense, biracial. 
Mr. Jensen said he used yellow, rather than white, because of its dominance in the Lego palette. "The way I portrayed it is kind of silly, but I don't think it's any more or less silly than it is in real life," he said. 
The films of Mr. Weychert, a graphic designer who lives near Philadelphia, are far less earnest, mixing social commentary with a slacker spirit. In "Twelve Bucks," an unemployed minifig gets a job but fails to realize that the cereal factory where he goes to work is really a missile plant. 
"I knew that I wanted the story to tell itself without the characters necessarily knowing what was really going on," Mr. Weychert said. The film, which can be seen at brickfilms.com or at bredstik.com, traveled briefly around the country as part of an independent film festival. 
Mr. Weychert's first film, "Siege on the Corporate Identity Plant," ridiculed corporate culture. "Heat, Part Two" (there is no "Part One") is a fantasy about accelerated global warming over New Jersey. He has started another project, "As Good as Soma," an anti-consumerist sendup whose title is derived from a reference Huxley makes to a drug in "Brave New World." 
"One of the challenges I'm looking forward to overcoming is making something that can actually be moving or gut-wrenching," Mr. Weychert said. 
The Lego company is aware of brick films and last year released an elementary filmmaking kit called the Lego & Steven Spielberg MovieMaker Set. But Lego officials may not have foreseen the circumstances their minifigs would find themselves in.
Q. Allan Brocka, a brick filmmaker based in Los Angeles, made an eight-part, sexually explicit series called "Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World." It has been screened at many film festivals, including Sundance. "Girl," a short by a filmmaker in Bangor, Maine, whose professional name is Ben B., includes an alarming sequence in which the Lego child's mother snorts a line of cocaine.
"That's not in line with our brand values and not something intended with our MovieMaker or our products in general," said Mike McNally, a Lego spokesman, referring to the cocaine sequence. But he said that Lego had no plans to take any action against brick filmmakers, who generally derive no money from their work.
Mr. Weychert joked: "It's the big thing right now, you know. Survivor and Lego animation."

HEADLINE: Measuring Success: At Least the Talks Didn't Collapse 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
For the Bush administration and other proponents of increasing commerce across borders, the biggest success of the trade talks that ended today in Qatar was that they did not fail.
 Buried in the complexity of the agreement worked out among the representatives of 144 nations are all kinds of provisions that could ultimately have a profound effect on governments and economies, on particular companies and industries, on workers and even on ways of life. 
 But as important as those details are, they were secondary over the last six days of negotiations to finding some way, through painful compromises and artful fudges, of building a consensus among the members of the World Trade Organization that liberalizing international trade was a priority worth sacrificing for.
The goal in Doha was quite limited: not to agree on dropping particular trade barriers or ending competition-stifling subsidies, but simply to agree on what issues should be put on the agenda for negotiations. 
Still, failure was a real possibility. The last attempt to begin a new round of trade liberalization talks melted down amid recriminations among governments and violence in the streets of Seattle in 1999. 
The trade ministers who gathered this time around were laboring not just under the shadow of Seattle, but also in a weakened global economy in which nations are under intense pressure to sacrifice the long-term economic potential of trade to the immediate political imperative of protecting domestic constituencies.
"Getting out of Doha with an agreement to launch a round was very important," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a research organization in Washington. "Had they not done that, the W.T.O. would have been seriously wounded. And you would have had a serious negative psychological impact on global markets that are already struggling, and backward movement on trade barriers and protectionism."
It may have been too much to say, as did Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, that "the stain of Seattle" has been removed. Seattle, and subsequent protests at other international gatherings, have shown the potency and the breadth of opposition to free trade and the concept of globalization. 
That these talks succeeded -- under heavy security, in a location inaccessible to most protesters, at a time when vigorous dissent risked seeming out of step with the campaign against terrorism -- did not by any means prove that the protesters had lost.
It was a clear signal, though, that the nations assembled in Qatar did not want to repeat the mistake of 70 years ago, when the United States and other nations deepened the Depression by resorting to protectionism when confronted with economic trouble at home.
It was also a victory for the administration in the sense of assembling another international coalition, however reluctant and tenuous, on an issue that it had explicitly cast as part of its effort to combat terror.
Today's deal, President Bush said, "sends a powerful signal that the world's trading nations support peaceful and open exchange and reject the forces of fear and protectionism."
In cobbling together language that allowed each country to claim to have avoided making any concessions that would bring objections at home, the Doha negotiations put off resolving the really difficult issues. 
The European Union still has not given up its insistence that it should be able to subsidize its farmers. India did not drop its position that the entire thrust of trade policy was unfair to the developing world.
Mr. Zoellick gave ground in a real way on some issues. He signaled that the United States was willing to tilt the balance between the pharmaceutical industry's right to patent protection and the developing world's need for drugs to fight scourges like AIDS in poor countries.
But he agreed to put other issues on the negotiating agenda without conceding that the United States had any intention of giving ground. Many nations think the United States is far too quick to protect industries like steel from foreign competition by invoking antidumping laws, which are intended to bar imports that are sold below cost.
But even before the Doha agreement was complete, Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary, said in an interview that the administration was only interested in clearing up confusion about how the United States and its trading partners could use such laws, not in restricting Washington's freedom to use them.
"It's not a matter of us saying we're not going to have the ability to use our anti-dumping laws," Mr. Evans said. "All we want to do is strengthen them."

HEADLINE: City Braces For Gridlock, Holding Line On Road Jobs 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
New street construction projects will be suspended from Monday until the new year as part of the city's plan to ward off traffic congestion during the holidays, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday.
 "We're going to try to cut out all nonessential construction work during this period except for emergency work," work related to ground zero in Manhattan or to the site of the plane crash on Monday in the Rockaways, the mayor said. 
 The street construction embargo will apply to public and private projects not already under way, officials said, and the city will issue construction permits only in essential cases. Iris Weinshall, the city's transportation commissioner, offered as an example a request by Con Edison to add service to a particular area. "We would say, 'Unless it's an emergency we'd rather you put it off till Jan. 2.' " 
Despite the drop in tourism, officials have identified 10 "gridlock alert" days, the first being tomorrow, when they expect the number of vehicles in Manhattan to exceed one million. The city plans to strictly enforce "Don't Block the Box" regulations, aimed at drivers whose vehicles obstruct intersections after the light has changed, and extra police officers will be on the streets citywide, officials said. 
The city also plans to modify the timing of traffic signals on crosstown streets to speed the flow and use signs with variable messages to alert drivers to street closings or other conditions. Ms. Weinshall said drivers should look for information on the signs or on the Department of Transportation's Web site (www.nyc.gov/calldot).
Although tourism is down over all since the terrorist attack, Mr. Giuliani said, and there are fewer international visitors, domestic tourism does not appear to have been affected, and might even be up a little. Referring to the number of event tickets sold and hotel rooms booked, the mayor said, "The sheer numbers now would have been a good year, like, two or three years ago."
With the holiday season approaching, the mayor said, he expected people to start complaining about traffic.
"You should count your blessings," Mr. Giuliani said. "The more the city has traffic problems, the better the economy of the city is doing."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INTERVIEWS; 
Prosecutors Begin Effort to Interview 5,000, but Basic Questions Remain

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
The interviews will take place in homes, not police stations. Miranda rights need not be read, though lawyers are welcome to sit in. Interpreters should be provided. Do not ask about religion. Do ask about violence and terrorism. Feel free to mention reward money.
 Those are among the guidelines for law enforcement officials now scrambling to interview more than 5,000 young men who have come to the United States from countries with suspected terrorist links on student, tourist or business visas within the last two years. In a Nov. 9 memorandum to federal prosecutors and antiterrorism task forces, Attorney General John Ashcroft asked that the interviews be completed within 30 days, a schedule he acknowledged was ambitious. 
 The memorandum includes a list of set questions -- about the interviewees' activities in the United States, familiarity with terrorist groups and experience with weapons -- and requests written reports on each conversation.
As the nation's 94 United States attorneys began doling out lists of names and addresses to local and state investigators yesterday, several officials expected to carry out the sweeping task said that Washington did not explain how the list was compiled and that they remained confused about how to proceed. One investigator who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the vast exercise "puts a tremendous strain on agencies" and raises "all sorts of civil liberties issues."
Arab and Muslims in the United States said they had already suffered weeks of ethnic profiling and discrimination from neighbors and strangers and now feel the government is supporting suspicion based on background, not behavior.
"I know it's an emergency, but we've got to be smart enough to watch that we don't throw away the freedoms of what America is all about," said Ismael Ahmed, director of the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services in Dearborn, Mich., home to the nation's largest concentration of people from the Middle East. "It could be students now, green card holders next, citizens after that. We've got to be careful."
In his memorandum, Mr. Ashcroft emphasized that "these individuals were not selected in order to single out a particular ethnic or religious group," and that they should not be treated as criminal suspects. 
"The list was generated by taking a population of individuals and applying to that population a set of generic parameters," the memorandum says. "These individuals were selected for interviews because they fit the criteria of persons who might have knowledge of foreign-based terrorists."
Those on the list are men ages 18 to 33; officials declined to specify the countries where their visas were issued. The United States attorney in Vermont, Peter W. Hall, said those on his district's short list were not from the Middle East. But officials said that most of the 5,000 names had Middle Eastern connections. In Los Angeles, an official said the 100 people on his list were mainly Arabs who share characteristics with the hijackers, such as being enrolled in flight training schools or scheduled to attend community colleges.
Many officials across the country said they had yet to start the interviews and refused to discuss it. "We are following the guidelines," said Fred Alverson of the United States attorney's office in Ohio. "I can't give any more specifics."
Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, compared the interview project to a neighborhood canvass after a murder.
"This is a preventative effort, focused on information gathering," Ms. Tucker said. "The instructions are clear. These are voluntary interviews, and anyone who doesn't want to answer questions doesn't have to."
Some civil liberties experts said such broad questioning of a group of foreigners was highly unusual, if not unprecedented.
"The legal dividing line between what's O.K. and what's not depends on exactly what they do, and with what tone," said Susan Herman, a professor at Brooklyn Law School. "Law enforcement people can always ask questions, and you don't have to answer. But people do have a tendency to think that if they're being asked questions, they should answer. Immigrants may be especially intimidated and feel they have to answer questions."
Among the concerns of Arab leaders and civil liberties advocates was what would happen if people's visas are found to be expired. 
In a companion memorandum to officials, also dated Nov. 9, the deputy attorney general says that "while the primary purpose of these interviews is not to ascertain the legality of the individuals' immigration status, the federal responsibility to enforce the immigration laws" is important. Interviewees suspected of being here illegally are to be reported to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the memorandum says. 
The newly announced interviews come after hundreds of foreign students have already been questioned by law enforcement officers in recent weeks. Raheem Yaseer, deputy director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, said F.B.I. agents have been polite, but left the students feeling uncomfortable nonetheless.
"They think it is a kind of discrimination, because they are not picked out randomly," Mr. Yaseer said. "There are lots of Latinos and there are lots of other people here, people from India -- they are not questioned."
In Pullman, Wash., at Washington State University, which has courted students from wealthy Persian Gulf states, an administrator said he did not know how his school and other universities would be affected, but that he would comply with "whatever the government mandates." 
"I personally wouldn't have any problem in helping to do what's necessary," said David Guzman, the school's registrar.
In Southern California, along a strip of Palestinian coffee shops not far from Disneyland known as Little Gaza, the sight of F.B.I. agents trolling for tips among store owners has become commonplace. Mazen Almoukdad, manager of a cellphone store, said business was off 40 percent because college students from Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are afraid to stroll the streets.
There was a mix of apprehension and acceptance among those who might just be on the Justice Department's list.
Mahmoud Khatid, a 36-year-old Palestinian who said he spent three years in the custody of the immigration service, said that despite his experience the questioning of Middle Eastern men about their knowledge of terrorist cells was understandable, under the circumstances of the Sept. 11 attacks.
"Any country would do these procedures," Mr. Khatid said. "There is nothing to worry about. A questioning is a questioning."
But Arsalan Iftikhar, a law student at Washington University in St. Louis and a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, was one of many people who compared the situation to "The Siege," a movie in which hundreds of Arabs are rounded up after a terrorist attack.
"We want to see the perpetrators brought to justice, but this sort of sweeping investigation really carries with it the potential of marginalizing an entire demographic," Mr. Iftikhar said. "We never thought they would go for people who are here lawfully. How do we know the next step is not going for citizens of Middle Eastern descent also? Where do we draw that line?"

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: FEDERAL AID; 
Panel Defeats Effort to Give Billions More To New York

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
A measure that would have provided billions of dollars to help New York recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist attack was narrowly defeated tonight by a House committee after the White House applied pressure on lawmakers to oppose it.
 The measure was advanced by a bipartisan coalition of New York lawmakers in the House who defied a veto threat from President Bush. 
 The vote against the measure by the House Appropriations Committee makes it doubtful that New York will get any additional federal aid this year beyond what the White House and Congress have agreed to provide.
The vote was 33 to 31. Thirty-two Republicans and one independent voted against the measure. The two New York Republicans on the committee joined 29 Democrats in supporting it. One Republican abstained. 
"It was really disappointing that my colleagues from across the aisle and from other states failed to support New York tonight," said Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from Westchester.
The vote came after a day of furious back-room negotiations and maneuvering. Vice President Dick Cheney even summoned several New York House members to the White House and urged them to abandon their plans and avoid a showdown, according to the lawmakers and their aides.
New York Democrats and Republicans had made the spending measure a top priority, hoping to test Mr. Bush's pledge to help New York in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.
More than that, Democrats saw the vote as an opportunity to highlight the difference between their priorities and those of the Bush White House and its Republican allies on Capitol Hill.
"It's like rubbing salt on New York's wound," said David Sirota, a spokesman for Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the committee.
The standoff arose out of the president's promise to provide New York with $20 billion in aid in the days after the terrorist attack. Since then, the administration has sought to deliver the money piecemeal.
That approach has drawn criticism from New York Democrats in the House, who have questioned whether the White House and Republican leaders in Congress could be trusted to fulfill the president's promise without public pressure.
The dispute reached a new level when House Democrats from New York managed to win the support of the two New York Republicans on the Appropriations Committee: Representatives James T. Walsh and John E. Sweeney, both from upstate.
Mr. Walsh and Mr. Sweeney joined New York Democrats in pushing a measure to provide $9.73 billion in additional aid for New York. The New York Democrats on the committee are Jose E. Serrano of the Bronx, Maurice D. Hinchey of Saugerties in the Hudson Valley, and Mrs. Lowey. 
Throughout the day, New York lawmakers worked furiously to win the support of their colleagues on the committee, where Republicans outnumber Democrats, 35 to 29.
But even before the vote was taken, it became increasingly apparent that the New Yorkers would probably fall a few votes short of victory. 
Earlier in the day, Mrs. Lowey emerged from her meeting with Mr. Cheney in the Roosevelt Room of the White House saying that the vice president had sought to reassure her that the administration had every intention of fulfilling the president's commitment in due time.
But she said she was not swayed by his arguments.
To date, the White House and Congress have moved to give New York about $9.2 billion of the $20 billion that President Bush promised. But New York lawmakers are worried that the White House and Congress will stall on the rest, particularly because Washington suddenly has to pay for antiterrorism measures and a war in Afghanistan as the national economy slumps.
The money that has been set aside came out of a $40 billion package that the president and Congress had approved to help pay for disaster relief, military actions and counterterrorism measures. President Bush has threatened to veto any bill adding money to that amount. 
New York's entire $20 billion was supposed to come out of that package. New York lawmakers said they decided to force the issue when they realized that the state would receive only about $9.2 billion of that $40 billion. The White House insists that the rest will come as New York needs it, presumably from some future appropriation.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED; 
Democrats' Stimulus Plan For Economy Dies in Senate

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Senate Republicans used procedural votes today to kill a $73 billion Democratic economic stimulus plan. After a party line vote failed to advance the measure, talks about alternatives accelerated. 
 Moderates offered proposals that they said would form appealing compromises between the Democratic bill, which emphasized aid to the unemployed, and Republican ones, which relied heavily on tax cuts. 
 Senate leaders sought support instead for immediate bipartisan negotiations with the House, which passed a $109 billion measure dominated by tax cuts on Oct. 24. And John Feehery, the spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, expressed guarded interest in the idea after rejecting it on Tuesday. Any bill to come out of such negotiations would then be voted on by both houses. 
A 51-to-47 majority of the Senate actually voted in support of the Senate Democratic bill today, but that fell short of the 60 votes required to overcome two points of order, asserting that the bill violated Senate procedures. The first objection was that $15 billion for homeland defense did not constitute an "emergency" under the budget act, which in past years has allowed extra spending for hiring census takers. 
The Bush administration opposed that spending as unnecessary and beyond limits agreed on in early October. But Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, argued: "We are now faced with security threats that were not foreseen last month -- the stuff of nightmares. Anthrax appeared like a vampire in the night, sapping us of our customary optimism. The threat of smallpox may face us for the first time in over 20 years." 
The second point of order was that the bill exceeded provisions for tax cuts and spending in this year's budget resolution. No one argued that it did not, but Democrats went through the ritual of moving to waive that provision and lost again by the same margin. All 50 Democrats and Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent, backed the bill. Forty-seven Republicans opposed it, and two did not vote.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader who argued intensely for the bill, had said repeatedly that he did not want to compromise once with Senate Republicans and again with House Republicans. Mr. Daschle has said negotiations should involve both parties, both houses and the Bush administration. The Republican leader, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, agreed.

HEADLINE: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; 
Out at the Ranch, Guests From Russia

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Vladimir V. Putin may have looked relaxed out here on the Texas prairie this afternoon, riding shotgun as he bounced along in President Bush's gleaming pickup. 
 But he still hasn't agreed to amend or walk away from an arms control treaty that prohibits the kind of antimissile system that Mr. Bush wants to test. Even Mr. Bush's pledge on Tuesday to cut America's nuclear arsenal by two-thirds did not succeed at that. So tonight, at the rambling stone house that the Bushes have just completed on the prairies and in the canyons that cut through central Texas, the president shifted to Plan B. 
 It involved plying the Russian president and his wife, Lyudmilia, with mesquite-smoked beef tenderloin, southern fried catfish, grilled sourdough bread and pecan pie, all washed down by a Texas hill country wine (really) and consumed to the country-and-western music of an Austin band, the Ranchhands.
No one knows whether this approach will work, especially as it was dampened by a thunderstorm that swept across the 1,600-acre ranch just as the festivities were supposed to get under way. 
But Mr. Bush's aides conceded that some unexpected obstacles had emerged to separate them from the grand bargain that they had envisioned here, including a Russian insistence that Mr. Bush's word to cut nuclear arms, however good, needs to be backed up by treaties. 
Still, Mr. Bush's aides insisted that they were not disappointed by the first day of talks in Washington. And they said that the meeting in this town of 631, a one-stoplight crossroads that this morning was dotted with handwritten greetings like, "Texas Says 'Howdy,' Russian President Putin," was just part of a complex process that will go on for months. 
But it was hard to hide the truth. Mr. Bush desperately wants a deal that would make it unnecessary for him to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, a move that would tear at the antiterrorism coalition that he has painstakingly built. He wants the deal struck here, where it could be called the Crawford accord.

Business Casual, Haltingly
Mr. Putin arrived here well briefed, and almost properly attired. By the time his helicopter touched down at the new helipad 500 yards or so from the Bushes' house, he was wearing black slacks, a black short-sleeve golf shirt and a wide belt. But at a moment when he desperately needed cowboy boots -- it's muddy on the ranch, especially today -- he was left with loafers, the surest giveaway in Crawford of a city slicker.
It wasn't Mr. Putin's first stop in Texas. He spent the morning with another Bush -- George H. W., the president's father -- at Rice University, where he addressed a concert hall filled with students, business leaders and members of the Texas political gentry. Lloyd M. Bentsen, the former senator and treasury secretary, watched in a wheelchair from the side of the hall, as Mr. Putin strode into the room accompanied by former President Bush and his former secretary of state, James A. Baker III. 
The oddity of the moment was striking. Critics of the elder Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker say the relationship now blossoming between the United States and Russia should have blossomed a decade ago. 
Mr. Putin recalled that when he first met Mr. Baker, he himself was a "modest city bureaucrat and Mr. Baker was a big boss." He briefly made the case that Russia needed a bigger voice in NATO -- membership and a vote would be nice, he seemed to suggest. But he sensed, correctly, that the invited crowd wanted to talk business, not politics. 
So he quickly turned to comparisons between Russia and Texas, focusing, naturally, on oil. "I'd like to say that in the Russian market, your risks are much lower than a few years ago," he said. 
Things would have been fine if he had stuck to the economic comparisons. But then he wound into a joke about cowboys in both countries that his translator mangled badly, and that left the audience entirely confused. "It sounded," an administration official said, "a little like our ABM negotiations."

New to the Prairie
Mr. Putin is the first foreign leader to visit Mr. Bush at what he calls his true home, and clearly Mr. Bush was itching to get back to the place he loves.
"We haven't been back since the war began," he said on Tuesday night. This morning, he was up at dawn running the trails down to the river and, then, after convening his daily national security meeting by videoconference, he was outside again, Reagan-like, clearing brush.
But he returned to a place that, like the rest of the country, has been changed by the attacks on Sept. 11. 
Farmers around here were cautioned that there was only one place for their crop dusters this week -- on the ground.
Fighter jets were constantly flying overhead. When Mohammad al-Alami, a reporter from Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television network, arrived at the Waco airport, he was temporarily detained because his company credit card was found to be "linked to Afghanistan," he reported. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed the detention, but said the reporter was released when it was clear that al Al Jazeera and Al Qaeda, the terrorist network, were very different. "I gave them my passport and my professional accreditation," he said, "but the people I've spoken to haven't heard of Jazeera." 
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the talk was all about dinner carefully planned for weeks by Laura Bush. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell flew in, along with Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, who recently took an American business group to Moscow. 
The triumverate of Mr. Bush's closest advisers was there as well, the chief of staff, Andrew H. Card, along with the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and Karen Hughes, Mr. Bush's counselor. (Karl Rove, the president's top political adviser, stayed away.)
Then there were the local celebrities -- Ben Crenshaw, the golfer, and Van Cliburn, the pianist, who lives in Fort Worth. A few of Mr. Bush's friends arrived, too, like Tony Garza, probably the first Texas railroad commissioner present at a United States-Russia summit meeting. 
They ate, the White House said, in a breezeway that connects the main house from the guest quarters. There were toasts, and a celebration of the release this evening of the eight humanitarian workers held hostage by the Taliban. Then Mr. Bush brought out a birthday cake for Ms. Rice, who turned 47 today. She and several other guests danced to Texas country tunes.

HEADLINE: Powell Poised To Announce New Strategy In Middle East 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is poised to unveil a new American strategy to end the violence between Israelis and Palestinians and restart talks aimed at creating a Palestinian state, senior administration officials said today.
 In a long-awaited speech that could be delivered as early as Monday during a scheduled visit to the University of Louisville in Kentucky, Secretary Powell will signal that the Bush administration will take a more active diplomatic role in bringing peace to the region, the officials said. 
 Still, these officials said, the speech will be directed as an emotional appeal to both sides to take concrete steps toward peace, not as a blueprint that somehow breaks from previous American positions.
They said a draft of the speech would urge Israel to halt the construction of any new settlements in Palestinian areas after a cease-fire is put in place and negotiations are resumed. 
It will also repeat calls to the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, to both end the violence and the incitement to violence and arrest those who are wanted for their suspected involvement in terrorist attacks.
"He always says he is doing that, that he is making the maximum effort," Secretary Powell said in an interview with The New York Times this week. "We think he can do more and I say that to him." 
Secretary Powell said that in his meeting with Mr. Arafat on Sunday, he told the Palestinian leader to "bring under control all of those elements under your control" and "use your moral authority as leader of the Palestinian people and not only end the violence but also end the incitement to violence." When that has been effort has been shown, Secretary Powell added, even if the results are less than 100 percent, "it gives us a lot more to work with." 
Officials said Secretary Powell would not incorporate President Clinton's outline that provides for Jerusalem to be open and undivided, the recognized capital of two states, Israel and Palestine. Instead, he would announce that the thorny issue should be left to the final stage of peace negotiations.
Secretary Powell said in the interview that the speech would be "a comprehensive statement of what the United States stands for," adding that it would build on President Bush's address to the General Assembly on Saturday, in which he said clearly that the state of Palestine should be created. 
But despite the fact that the Middle East speech has been in the works for months, a final draft has yet to be agreed on and the White House has not given final approval, a senior administration official said. 
Mr. Bush came into office determined not to take the same active role that President Clinton had, which comes with the risk of failure. During the October 2000 presidential debate, for example, Mr. Bush said that "it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place," a criticism of Mr. Clinton's failure to broker a peace agreement at Camp David last year. 
Asked whether Mr. Bush would assume a larger peace-making role, Secretary Powell said that the United States needed to "build slowly and carefully" and that when there is progress Mr. Bush will become "more engaged than he is now."
Until the Sept. 11 attacks, there was considerable resistance inside the administration to a Powell speech that would commit the United States to take a more hands-on role. 
But perhaps more than other senior official, Secretary Powell has recognized the deep resentment and anger in the Arab and Muslim world toward the United States because of the Palestinian crisis. Asked by the Jazeera television network six days after the attacks why America is hated in the Muslim world, Secretary Powell acknowledged that violence in the Middle East had created a "sense of hopelessness" and that terrorism is fueled by these "grievances."
In the interview, Secretary Powell stressed that it was "essential to move quickly in order to jump-start the Palestinian economy again, let people get to work and remove the level of humiliation that exists in the region." That reality "adds to the anxiety and the aggressive activity and behavior on the part of so many people," he said.
One element inhibiting a more concrete American plan is that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who is now scheduled to visit Washington the first week in December, and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel themselves have still not forged a common strategy.
Secretary Powell was to have announced his Middle East strategy in a speech to the General Assembly in September, which was delayed because of the terrorist attacks. In the interview, Secretary Powell joked that his was "the most famous non-speech ever given this year."

HEADLINE: Despite Woes, Indonesia Economy Grew in 3rd Quarter 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Indonesia's currency is sliding, inflation is rising and government finances are a mess. But its economy still managed to grow faster than expected in the third quarter, demonstrating what the World Bank calls the country's ability to muddle through the global slowdown and its own political confusion.
 Indonesia's Central Bureau of Statistics said today that the economy grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter, compared with the third quarter of 2000, largely on the strength of low-end manufactured exports and domestic consumption. Exports, though slowing, were up 6.6 percent in the third quarter; domestic spending rose 7.1 percent. 
 At the same time, the government appears headed for a fiscal breakdown unless it can somehow push through long-delayed asset sales by the end of the year. Publicly, officials express optimism, but finance ministry officials said they were holding meetings to decide which government programs -- from public housing and rural finance to education and disaster relief -- would be cut back to close a probable budget deficit of at least 30 trillion rupiah ($2.8 billion).
While the rest of the world assesses how much has changed since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, in Indonesia the atmosphere is very much one of business as usual, or rather turmoil as usual. Though the country has made significant progress under a $5 billion rescue program from the International Monetary Fund, it has yet to recover from the currency and financial crises that swept Asia in 1997 and 1998. In the three and one-half years since the fall of Suharto, three successive presidents have failed to overcome parliamentary bickering and push through controversial reform measures, rein in corruption or restore investor confidence. 
"The problem is politics," said Steven Hess at Moody's Investors Service in New York. "That's the price of converting form 32 years of one-man rule to democracy. It's messy."
Indonesia is both large enough -- its population of 204 million is No. 4 in the world after China, India and the United States -- and poor enough that domestic spending on even basic consumer necessities can yield economic growth. Indonesians manage to save a fairly high proportion of their annual income, which averages $600 a person, allowing them to keep spending even in difficult times. And in contrast to wealthier neighbors like Singapore and Malaysia, Indonesia does not depend on high-technology exports and has not been hit hard by the slowdown in that sector.
The problem is that economic growth has not been fast enough to generate the millions of new jobs the country needs to keep ahead of population growth and keep more citizens from slipping into poverty.
Economists say Indonesia must find a way to attract much more foreign investment, which fell 50 percent in the first nine months of 2001, to $6.05 billion. 
Beyond regional unrest and political uncertainty, investors are disappointed by the government's failure to keep promises to privatize its business holdings. A planned sale of the state's 51 percent stake in Bank Central Asia, which may raise 5 trillion rupiah ($470 million) or more, is now unlikely to happen before year-end, officials acknowledge. A deal to sell the country's largest cement company, Semen Gresik, to Cemex of Mexico for another 5 trillion rupiah has foundered over local opposition to foreign ownership. 
As a result, Indonesia's currency has fallen more than 10 percent this year, pushing up prices for imported goods and leading the central bank to raise interest rates while most of the world's main central banks were cutting them. Higher rates raised the cost of servicing the government's debt, now equivalent to more than 90 percent of Indonesia's gross domestic product, and left the Jakarta government unable to use either of the traditional tools for stimulating the economy -- added public spending and looser monetary policy.
"Everything at the end of the day centers on the rupiah," said Heriyanto Irawan, head of research at Merrill Lynch in Jakarta. "And the direction of the rupiah depends on the level of confidence in the government."
Along with foreign aid, asset sales are supposed to plug Indonesia's budget deficit, but the government is 13 trillion rupiah ($1.2 billion) short of its sales target for the year. And failure to live up to past commitments to international aid agencies, including the World Bank, has denied Indonesia roughly $1.7 billion in new foreign loans. The agencies say continued failures may deny Indonesia another $1.3 billion next year.
But Indonesia's economy will muddle through anyway, the World Bank said in its report. Illustrating how, the country's automotive industry reported today that car sales rose 2.2 percent in the first 10 months of the year, while sales of motorbikes more than doubled.

HEADLINE: Brazil Welcomes Global Move on Drug Patents 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
The Brazilian government, which has challenged the giant drug companies' patent defenses perhaps more aggressively than any other country, hailed the World Trade Organization's declaration on drug patents as an important victory for the developing world's fight against health scourges like AIDS.
 The decision also promises to open the way for Brazil to realize a long-held ambition: to export its low-cost versions of AIDS drugs to countries without the resources to produce their own. 
 Such exports have frequently been blocked by confusion surrounding international patent rules and by pressure from multinational pharmaceutical companies, which scared off many countries that might have been buyers. 
In Brazil's view, the text of the agreement reached at Doha, Qatar, gives each of the organization's 144 members discretion to set its own rules for issuing "compulsory licenses," which force patent holders to allow rivals to manufacture patented drugs. And each country is free under the agreement to set its own criteria for what constitutes a national public health emergency, the justification for compulsory licenses. 
Before the Doha conference, the question of compulsory licenses had been left unclear in the organization's 1994 treaty on intellectual property rights. 
Brazil has been on the forefront of attacking AIDS in the developing world since 1998, when it began copying and producing some of the antiretroviral drugs used in "cocktails" to treat AIDS. The Health Ministry provides the cocktails free to patients, and turned to making them domestically when the cost of importing brand name drugs threatened to bankrupt the program. Brazilian patent law protects drugs only if they were commercialized after 1997.
Unlike India, where private companies do most of the copycat drug making, Brazil has made patent breaking a direct activity of the government. Seven state-owned laboratories now produce generic copies of 8 of the 12 drugs used in the AIDS cocktail, at a tiny fraction of the prices charged by multinational pharmaceutical giants like Merck and Roche.
Under pressure from the drug companies, the United States government threatened to bring a complaint against Brazil at the World Trade Organization, accusing it of violating the 1994 treaty. The complaint was dropped after a sustained public outcry, and Brazil reached accommodations with some of the giant drug makers.
Now, the Brazilian government says, the Doha declaration means that it no longer has anything to fear from such complaints.

After Sept. 11, value and price become the themes for promoting holiday shopping.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
AS retailers face their most challenging holiday shopping season in decades, they are striving to entice consumers into stores with campaigns playing up value without hurting their brand images by running schlocky ads that scream "Sale!"
 The struggle by retail chains simultaneously to meet short-term goals like salvaging the fourth quarter and long-term goals like reinforcing relationships with customers is evident in watching how holiday campaigns, now beginning to run, veer from brand-burnishing to a hard sell and back again; some companies, like Sears, Roebuck are trying to do both. 
 Getting consumers in a spending mood "is going to be tough," said Walter Levy, managing director for retail trends and positioning at Kurt Salmon Associates in New York. "Anybody who thinks otherwise is a fool."
"If I were a retailer today, I would look at my pricing instead of waiting for something not to sell," he added, "because some people, stuck with inventory, will go down and dirty right away to move the goods." 
Complicating the process is a need to make pitches more reflective of life after Sept. 11 by giving more prominence to emotional appeals centered on family, friendship, comfort and tradition. That can be difficult when an ad also has to promote sale prices on boom boxes, sweaters or power tools.
"You want to slam them over the head, but do it in a way that feels good," said David McLean, creative director at Banana Republic in San Francisco, a chain owned by Gap Inc. that is proceeding with plans for a low-key print and outdoor campaign, created by an in-house team, "with a good familiarity that feels appropriate right now."
While "at holiday we become a little more pointed about calling out certain products and product categories" like sweaters and scarves, Mr. McLean said, "we're walking a fine line to convey a product message while keeping our messages focused on relationships and warmth as appropriate to the season."
The compromise adopted by many retailers and agencies is to run ads shining a spotlight on particular merchandise, especially gift fodder, without including prices -- reserving offers, coupons and deals for brochures, catalogs, direct mail and fliers.
"I think it's going to be a tough holiday," said Michael James Leedy, chief marketing officer at American Eagle Outfitters in Warrendale, Pa., which specializes in casual apparel for teenagers and 20-somethings, "but it will depend on where you're positioned as a brand."
"Our main strength is image; that's what we're about," he added. "If you're approachable, affordable, attainable, you'll do fine." American Eagle is moving ahead with a brand-building television and print campaign created by an in-house team before Sept. 11, which carries the cozy theme "Get together"; at the same time, Mr. Leedy said, mailed ads are "focusing on driving traffic with offers tailored to different customers "
American Eagle's main competitor, Abercrombie & Fitch, scrapped its centerpiece holiday promotion, the winter edition of its quarterly "magalog," citing the inappropriateness of the racy content in these uncertain times. Instead, the company will decorate stores with brand-polishing posters and send out 750,000 copies of a catalog mixing price-and-item information with lifestyle photographs.
"We anticipate intense promotional pricing, earlier discounts and couponing, and price wars in the discount sector," said David Selby, senior vice president for marketing at Sears in Hoffman Estates, Ill. "We want to play to our strengths in driving profitable growth."
So starting Wednesday, Sears will run a humorous campaign mixing brand and price messages on TV and online and in magazines and movie theaters, which "balances our desire to position Sears as a retailer who understands your life," Mr. Selby said, "and one that has extraordinary value."
Work by one agency, the Chicago office of Young & Rubicam Advertising, part of the Young & Rubicam division of the WPP Group, is more image-oriented, while work by another agency, the Chicago office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, also owned by WPP, specifies that products like JVC camcorders will be on sale at half their regular prices.
"We don't scream the price and item," said Joe Sciarrotta, co-managing director and executive creative director at Ogilvy Chicago. "They're loud because the creative stops you" with surprising juxtapositions like showing a dog devouring a guest's coat at a party, which is followed by the words "Men's and women's leather outerwear, 50 percent off."
His counterpart at Y.& R. Chicago, Mark Figliulo, managing partner and chief creative officer, said: "It has to connect, it has to mean more than a price point, because there are a lot of price-point ads out there. How would you differentiate yourself in that sea of offerings?"
Another Gap Inc. division, Gap, hopes to make a connection with a simple campaign, focused on sweaters, created by Modernista in Boston and carrying the theme "Give your gift." Gap will make donations to charities on behalf of the celebrities appearing in the commercials and print ads, who include the singers Sheryl Crow and Alanis Morissette and the cast of "The Producers."
To help make the campaign less ethereal, the one publication chosen to carry the most print ads, 29 pages, is the December issue of Lucky, the new magazine devoted to shopping from the Conde Nast Publications division of Advance Publications.
"Gap chose to run a major image campaign in a shopping environment," said Alexandra W. Golinkin, publisher at Lucky. "No matter what page you pick, there is shopping."
One retailer embracing price-oriented ads is the Kmart Corporation. Kmart is running a campaign by the New York office of TBWA/Chiat/ Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group, depicting sales on specific products like Samsung DVD players and Sony PlayStation 2 video game systems; the lowered prices "are our gift to you," the commercials proclaim.
"It's not a pure branding campaign because it's not the right time right now for that," said Steven P. Feuling, senior vice president for marketing at Kmart in Troy, Mich.
"Before Sept. 11, we saw this was going to be a value Christmas because of issues with the economy," he added. "Now it's going to be an even bigger value Christmas for us."
What is in store from Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer? Brand-building commercials to be introduced next week will present customers and employees "sharing their holiday stories" that are "reflective of what's going on with people right now," said Alicia Kriese, senior vice president and group account director at a Wal-Mart agency, GSD&M in Austin, Tex., part of Omnicom.
"Our insight is that our customers want even more of what Wal-Mart is in their lives in these uncertain times," she added.
The varied approaches make sense to Cary Silvers, vice president at Roper ASW in New York, the research company that is part of the NOP division of United Business Media, based on the results of consumer surveys.
"A lot of consumers are sitting on the fence in terms of confidence," Mr. Silvers said, "so the messaging is critical right now because you don't want to give consumers a reason not to come into the stores."
"In an economic downturn, brands that deliver on promises of quality and image should sustain themselves," he added, "but the ones that don't are in jeopardy."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Blue Chips Up, but Cut in Economic Forecast Limits Gains

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Confident of an economic turnaround in 2002, investors bid blue-chip shares higher yesterday. But a scaled-down outlook for the nation's economy limited the advance, and profit taking caused a slight dip in technology stocks.
 Yesterday's mixture of modest gains and slim losses was understandable, given how Wall Street has been rallying for weeks. 
 Investors have been growing more optimistic that the economy will recover next year and are encouraged by signs that the United States has been successful in its retaliation in Afghanistan for the Sept. 11 attacks. But analysts have said the market's rallies are vulnerable until the turnaround becomes more apparent.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 48.78 points, or 0.5 percent, at 9,872.39. The Dow has gained 318 points in its three-day advance and is approaching 10,000, a level that has eluded it since Sept. 5, when it closed at 10,033.27.
The broader market closed fairly flat after advancing earlier. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.62 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,900.57, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,142.24. 
Analysts have been expecting investors to curtail their buying or to secure recent profits, particularly when reminded of the weak economy; that was the case yesterday when the International Monetary Fund downgraded its outlook for the nation's growth.
Updating its economic forecast to reflect the business fallout resulting from the terrorist attacks, the I.M.F. cut its estimate of United States growth in 2002 to 0.7 percent. That would be the weakest performance since the end of the last recession in 1991. Just a month ago, the I.M.F. forecast a 2.2 percent rate.
Analysts were not bothered by the I.M.F. downgrade.
"They are probably lagging in their process," A. C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif., said. "The market looks ahead, and I think those were thoughts that reflect the past and current situations as opposed to the future." 
Mr. Moore said the market had risen on indications, like stronger retail sales, that business was improving. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that retail sales rose 7.1 percent in October, the biggest monthly increase on record, a sharp contrast to the 2.2 percent decline in sales in September.
Wall Street's winners came from a variety of areas yesterday. American Express rose 96 cents, to $34.39; McDonald's gained 82 cents, to $28.36; and Wal-Mart Stores advanced 72 cents, to $56.
Other companies rose on better-than-anticipated earnings results. Children's Place, a retailer, rose nearly 16 percent, or $4.33, to $32.14, after beating profit expectations by 6 cents a share.
Analysts said the possibility of lower oil prices was another positive for the economy, and it helped the market yesterday.
OPEC's most powerful member, Saudi Arabia, said the oil cartel would let crude prices fall if necessary as a way of pressing outside producers into cooperating with its plan to cut output. --------------------

Treasury Prices Tumble
(By Reuters)
Treasury bond prices plunged yesterday as flickerings of life in the economy dimmed hopes for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 2 points, to a price of 101 22/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.78 percent from 4.53 percent on Wednesday. 
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 3 10/32, to 102 2/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.24 percent from 5.02 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Environmentalists Concerned About State Plan for Borrowing 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
The Pataki administration is considering borrowing money to pay for some environmental programs that are usually financed through a special $150 million fund, stirring fears among environmentalists that the governor intends to raid the fund to help balance next year's budget.
 The Environmental Protection Fund was the only pot of money entirely left out of the final supplemental budget deal that legislative leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki hammered out last month. Established in 1993, the fund is paid for by a special tax on real estate transfers. By law, it can only be used for the purchase of parkland and other environmental programs. 
 But this year legislative leaders never reached agreement with the governor over how to spend the money, so the Assembly and Senate never voted to appropriate the money. After the September terrorist attack wreaked havoc on state revenues, leaders in both houses said the governor made it clear in private talks that he did not want to spend the fund this fiscal year.
Last Thursday, a senior aide to Mr. Pataki told a delegation of environmentalists that the administration had no intention of spending the $150 million this fiscal year, which ends on March 31. 
Instead, the aide, John Cahill, a former environmental commissioner, told the environmentalists that the administration might borrow about $60 million to pay for some of the fund's programs. That would leave most of the $150 million sitting in a bank account. Some environmentalists said they saw the proposal as a prelude to Mr. Pataki's asking the Legislature to let him use the fund to plug holes in next year's budget.
"We left the meeting feeling discouraged, to say the least," said Val Washington, the executive director of Environmental Advocates. "We don't want this year's Environmental Protection Fund raided, and that's what we are fighting for."
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, the environmental committee chairman who sponsored the law setting up the fund, said Mr. Pataki had tarnished his record on the environment. "When I offered the law, it was to make sure the environment never played second fiddle as it had in the past," he said. "This is about the governor insisting the environment play second fiddle."
In an interview this week, Mr. Cahill said the governor had not yet decided whether to use the borrowing plan to finance the acquisition of parkland and other fund programs. Among other purposes, the grants would be used for spurring recycling, creating town parks, revitalizing waterfronts and studying pollutants in the Hudson River.
Mr. Cahill also said it was too early to say if the governor would seek legislative approval to use the fund to avert cuts to other parts of the state budget. Neither had the governor ruled the idea out, he said.
"There is no plan, but this is a fluid process," Mr. Cahill said. "There is no program in the state that will not be touched by the enormous problem the state faces in light of the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks. We are looking at all our options." 
Budget officials say the state will lose as much as $9 billion in revenues over the next 18 months because of the terrorist attack's devastating effect on the state's economy.
Governor Pataki, who often cites Theodore Roosevelt as his hero, has earned very high marks, even from his critics, for his record on protecting wilderness and expanding parks, adding more than 300,000 acres during his time as governor. Under his tenure, the Environmental Protection Fund grew to $150 million from $25 million.
But his refusal to spend the money set aside this year has drawn fire not only from his Democratic opponents, like State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, but also from some of his staunchest friends among conservationists.
"This would represent a 180-degree turn from his past performance," said John F. Sheehan of the Adirondack Council. "That's troublesome for everyone."
Aides to the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, said he would withhold judgment on using the fund for other purposes until it becomes clearer how far revenues will fall off. But the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said he still hoped to reach an agreement with the governor to spend the money in this fiscal year. "It is our intention to use it for what it was intended," he said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Drop for Third Consecutive Week 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
The number of workers filing initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest level since mid-September, the government reported today, signaling that the job cuts after the terrorist attacks are abating.
 New jobless claims fell to 444,000 in the week that ended Saturday, the Labor Department said. It was the third consecutive weekly decline, the first time that has happened since July. 
 A separate report showed business inventories fell for an eighth consecutive month in September, the longest string since August 1982 to March 1983, when the economy was emerging from recession.
The reports, combined with a strong retail sales report on Wednesday, suggest that the economic slowdown may be nearing an end.
"Businesses keep cutting stocks, and there are fewer people lining up for unemployment benefits," said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. "Combine this with the huge rise in October sales and you have to believe that the worst may be over for the economy."
Still, while the pace of jobless claims is slowing, companies are not hiring. Total jobless benefit rolls rose to an 18-year high of 3.826 million in the week ended Nov. 3 as laid-off workers found that there were few new jobs available.
"If you're out of work, you're not finding a new job," even though "the pace of layoffs has clearly slowed after the tidal wave that Sept. 11 caused," said Steven Wood, chief economist with FinancialOxygen Inc. in Walnut Creek, Calif.
And while companies kept reducing stockpiles in September, sales plunged 2.8 percent. That pushed up the inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of the time goods sit on shelves, to 1.45 months in September.
That is the highest ratio since September 1998 and follows a reading of 1.42 months in August.
Businesses have been cutting inventories all year. Stockpiles fell at an annual rate of $50.4 billion in the third quarter after declining $38.3 billion in the second quarter and $27.1 billion in the first three months of this year.

Dell Rebounds After a 2nd-Quarter Loss

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
Rebounding from a loss in the July quarter, the Dell Computer Corporation reported a third-quarter profit of $429 million yesterday. Its earnings fell by a third from the period a year ago but edged past Wall Street's estimates.
 Dell, the world's leading vendor of personal computers, which account for about half its business, continued to drive down its selling prices and take market share from competitors. Dell was the only major PC vendor to grow in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, analysts said. 
 But the company, based in Austin, Tex., is still fighting for a growing piece of a shrinking market. Dell predicted that it would sell about 5 percent more computers in the current quarter than in the last, outpacing the rest of the industry. But Dell said that revenue would improve only slightly over its third quarter, which ended Nov. 2, and that earnings would be flat, at 16 cents.
For the third quarter of its 2002 fiscal year, Dell posted net income of $429 million, or 16 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus estimates by a penny a share. Earnings declined 36 percent from the period a year ago, when Dell earned $674 million, or 25 cents a share.
Revenue of $7.47 billion surpassed consensus expectations by $150 million, declining 10 percent from the third quarter a year ago.
"We were the only major systems company to grow units year-on-year and sequentially in every product category," said James M. Schneider, Dell's chief financial officer. "Once again, we have demonstrated that Dell's business model is potent in all economic cycles."
Dell released its earnings after the markets closed. In regular trading, shares of Dell rose 23 cents, to $27.69. In after-hours trading, shares fell to $27.30.
Many analysts have predicted that uncertainty surrounding the proposed merger of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer would drive customers to competitors like Dell, especially if their efforts to overcome Wall Street's skepticism distracted them from their day-to-day business.
Hewlett-Packard diffused some of the criticism Wednesday when it announced better-than-expected earnings, and revenue that exceeded most analysts' projections by about $1 billion. Hardware and software sales fell sharply, and its PC division continued to lose money despite improving sales of PC's for the home, but cost-saving programs helped earnings more than anticipated. 
Still, Dell executives said they had sold systems to customers fleeing those companies. Kevin B. Rollins, the president and chief operating officer, said in a conference call with reporters that his competitors were "a bit more entangled" in their internal operations. 
"Customers in that environment are a little nervous and, more often than not, going with Dell," Mr. Rollins said. 
Dell was coming off a difficult second quarter, when it posted a loss of $101 million, or 4 cents a share, largely because of charges related to job cuts, asset write-downs and factory closings. 
Despite slowing demand for PC's, Dell has steadily gained market share since the beginning of this year, rising to 26 percent of the United States market, from 20 percent. In preliminary figures released last month, the International Data Corporation, a market research firm, said worldwide PC sales in the third quarter declined 14 percent over the same period last year and 1 percent from the second quarter, in stark contrast to the 15 percent growth typically seen from the second quarter to the third. 
Sales of Dell's servers, storage systems and workstations, all high-powered corporate computers, rose 20 percent over the previous year, the company said.
Michael S. Dell, the chief executive, said Pentium 4 chips from Intel, the Windows XP operating system from Microsoft and new wireless networking products from several vendors would lead the industry to its next upgrade cycle beginning next spring or summer. 
By the end of the quarter, Windows XP was shipping in 46 percent of consumer PC's. Sixty-two percent of desktop computers were sold with Pentium 4 chips.
Mr. Dell estimated that 164 million PC's worldwide were more than three years old, and 450 million PC's contain chips running at less than 700 megahertz, about a third the speed of the fastest processors on the market today.
"We would expect that in the spring and in the summer, there is going to be a lot of upgrade activity going on among corporations," he said. "Certainly factors like the economic stimulus being debated right now would have some impact on that."
James D. Ragan, a senior equity analyst with Crowell, Weedon & Company, a Los Angeles brokerage firm, said Dell's aggressive price cuts, which drove average system prices last quarter down $50, to $1,800, were inflicting pain upon its competitors. He said Dell should reap the benefits in the future.
"If you believe we're going to get a meaningful recovery, that's certainly good news for Dell shareholders," Mr. Ragan said.

HEADLINE: Boon for U.S. in Cheaper Energy; 
OPEC Disunity May Prop Up Hard-Pressed Businesses

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
OPEC's problems could translate into substantial benefits for American business and consumers.
 With oil prices falling as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fails to reach agreement with Russia and other oil producers outside the cartel, the United States is poised to receive a much needed lift from lower energy costs, analysts said. That relief, together with lower interest rates, is expected to improve the odds that the economy will emerge from its downturn sooner rather than later. 
 "The U.S. economy runs well on cheap oil and cheap money, and right now they're both cheap," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/WEFA, an economic consulting firm. "So we can look at the economy improving next year." 
Oil prices, which were hovering at $30 a barrel as recently as early September, fell to $17.45 yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, raising the prospect of cheaper gas at the fuel pump and lower energy costs for a wide range of industries -- from struggling airlines and automakers to fertilizer producers and electric power generators.
No one is sure how long oil prices will remain this low or to what degree lower fuel prices will bolster the $10 trillion United States economy. But even though oil and gas drillers in the Southwest and Rocky Mountain states will take a hit, the overall effect on the United States economy should be positive, economists said.
Some of the effects may already be noticeable. The price of natural gas, which is used to heat homes and factories and to power manufacturing, has plummeted to about $2.30 per million British thermal units from about $10 a year ago, sharply reducing the cost of energy.
The sharp drop in oil prices in recent weeks, if it lasts, could generate an even greater benefit for consumers. Some economic models show that for every $1 decrease in the cost of a barrel of oil, American consumers gain about $5 billion in spending power. A drop from about $30 a barrel last year to about $20 a barrel over the next year would translate into about $50 billion in consumer spending power.
"That's roughly the size of the tax rebate, so that's a significant savings," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, based in West Chester, Pa. "And that's just consumers; businesses could also save billions of dollars."
Since automobiles and light trucks consume nearly half of the oil sold in the United States, the biggest savings are expected to go to consumers, giving their pocketbooks a much needed injection of cash just in time for the holiday shopping season, economists said.
That would be a sharp turnaround after a year in which prices at the gas pump rose to $2.25 a gallon in some places. Rising diesel and jet fuel prices also hurt the airline industry even before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and forced several big package delivery companies, like FedEx and United Parcel Service, to impose fuel surcharges of 1 to 4 percent.
Only a few years ago, U.P.S. was spending about $700 million a year on fuel. Last year, the company's fuel costs climbed to about $930 million, according to Steve Holmes, a spokesman for the company in Atlanta.
In recent weeks, the price of gasoline in much of the country has fallen below $1.20 a gallon -- and it could be headed lower, oil industry experts say.
Paying less for gasoline or home heating fuel could aid consumer spending, economists say.
"That means we have more money to spend on other things, like going to movies, going out to restaurants and going shopping," said Ms. Latta of DRI/WEFA. "And if you can keep the consumer spending you can mitigate the effects of the slowing economy."
Among those companies that would benefit from lower oil prices are the airlines and trucking concerns, as well as chemical, metal and paper producers.
Some economists warn, though, that lower oil prices could eventually come back to bite the American economy because of weakening demand for United States products abroad.
"I think initially it's good for the U.S. economy, but it's not that clear over time," said James E. Glassman, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan. "It creates dislocation in emerging markets like Russia and the Middle East. When their oil revenues go down, their buying power goes down."
Some companies would suffer in the short run, including Exxon Mobil, Kerr-McGee, ChevronTexaco and other big oil companies. Some of the bigger diversified ones, which also refine and have chemical and other operations, are somewhat insulated, but just about every oil company should have a drop in earnings growth after two years of heavy consolidation and spectacular profit growth.
"The party is over," said Eugene Nowak, an oil industry analyst at ABN-Amro. "The companies have had some good times, but the third quarter started showing some weakness. Earnings will be down considerably in the fourth quarter."
Several oil analysts, however, said the industry never expected prices to stay above $25 a barrel for long. The companies knew these were extraordinarily good times, and many were careful not to overextend themselves, the analysts said. 
The oil companies have been trimming back their costs, analysts said, in anticipation of a slowdown. There will still be profits in the next few quarters, but they will not be as fat.
"Are we looking at an industry in trouble? Absolutely not," said Mark Flannery, an oil analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "We're looking at an industry that's going to earn a lot less money, but the last two years we've had a bonanza."

OIL PRICES TUMBLE TO A 2-YEAR LOW

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE with NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Oil prices went into free fall today as Russia, the world's biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, rejected a challenge from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stabilize prices by sharply cutting production.
 Prices in New York dropped 11.6 percent, to $17.45 a barrel, their lowest level in more than two years. Crude oil prices have fallen 21 percent this week. 
 Analysts said the recession-bound economy of the United States would receive a much-needed lift from plummeting energy costs, with consumers freed to spend more on holiday purchases and with beleaguered airlines and cargo haulers bearing one less burden. Page C1. 
Experts added that Russia's stance reflected both the government's limited control over Russian oil companies and Moscow's post-Sept. 11 collaboration with the West. Russia and the United States, they added, share OPEC's concerns that prices might fall too far and shake regimes whose stability is especially critical to the war on terrorism.
OPEC leaders acknowledged that their unexpected decision on Wednesday not to reduce oil production unless other major exporters did the same amounted to the declaration of a price war.
The cartel's gamble is that falling oil prices will persuade its competitors to blink and join in production cuts. OPEC said it expected Norway and Mexico, the second- and third-largest producers outside the group, to come around.
But Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov of Russia said today during an official visit to Spain that his country would resist "any big reductions" beyond the token reduction of 30,000 barrels a day that it promised earlier in the week.
In a telephone interview from Spain, Aleksei Volin, the deputy head of the Russian government's administration, explained that deeper cuts could endanger Russia's obligations to its customers in Europe, where it sends most of its oil exports. 
OPEC leaders acknowledge that Russia has become the market's linchpin. "We cannot have cuts without Russia," Adil Khalid al-Subih, Kuwait's oil minister, said in an interview in Vienna. "We will not support any cuts without a significant contribution from non-OPEC nations. They know exactly what they are doing. It is not a matter of convincing them."
The question that will loom larger each day, OPEC officials and industry experts said, is who will surrender first, as prices enter a tailspin and ravage economies highly dependent on oil revenues. 
"It's a game of chicken," said Roger Diwan, managing director at the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting group in Washington. "OPEC wants to scare Russia and the Russian oil companies. They want to show that with low oil prices, everybody will hurt."
To bolster oil prices in a slowing global economy, OPEC has pared its daily output three times this year for a total of 3.5 million barrels, or 13 percent. But the cartel's rivals have responded by increasing their production, grabbing market share and cashing in on prices that have averaged more than $25 a barrel.
OPEC's 10 voting members have said that they will no longer tolerate that situation. They proposed on Wednesday that OPEC would reduce output by a further 1.5 million barrels a day as of Jan. 1, if non-OPEC producers cut by a total of 500,000 barrels a day. 
For Russia, the decision to defy OPEC may be less a national energy strategy and more an effort to avoid confrontation with the country's powerful oil companies. Under Russian law, the government has some control over oil exports. But unlike the situations in Mexico and Norway, in Russia most of the industry is in private hands and the government has been hesitant to force companies to cut.
Some Russian companies that have worked the hardest to increase production and restore an industry that had collapsed with the fall of the Soviet Union are adamantly opposed to cuts. They would force layoffs, executives argue, and waste expensive new technology bought over the last three years.
"If they say we have to cut, we will cut, but I'll do everything I can to show it is unreasonable," Mikhail Khodorkovsky, chief executive of Yukos, Russia's second-largest oil producer, said today at a news conference in Moscow.
Still, Russia's warming relations with the United States since Sept. 11 may also be playing a role in its oil policy. President Vladimir V. Putin reiterated last month that Russia could serve the West as an alternative source of energy to a destabilized Middle East. 
Mr. Khodorkovsky echoed that theme today. "We can propose a real partnership with the West in creating a stable market for oil," he said. "That window of opportunity is today."
Other Russian oil companies indicated, however, that there was room for compromise with OPEC, in part because a further slide in oil prices -- to $15 a barrel or less -- would force the layoffs or cutbacks in exploration and production that they are trying to avoid.
Lukoil, its biggest producer, said the Russian oil industry could withstand a cut of 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day. The third-largest producer, Tyumen Oil, said it would begin trimming its investment program if prices fell below $17 a barrel.
One high-level OPEC official said today that the United States government would be concerned, too, if prices fell below about $15 a barrel. The Americans, he said, understand that as Persian Gulf nations lose oil revenue, the welfare states they support come under stress. That, he said, could pose more of a threat to their stability than bombing raids in Afghanistan that are unpopular among many Arab citizens. 
Dr. Subih, the Kuwait oil minister, told reporters in Vienna that prices could fall to $10 a barrel -- a level not flirted with since late 1998 -- if non-OPEC producers did not join the cartel in cutting production. A price war, he acknowledged, could be damaging to OPEC members, whose economies are lopsidedly reliant on oil revenue. 
But the cartel is betting that Russia, too, will feel the pain. Oil is at the heart of Russia's economy; together with natural gas, it makes up half of the country's earnings from exports. The Moscow government's federal budget is balanced delicately on an oil price of about $20. This year's budget surplus provides a cushion, but a long period of low prices could mean difficult spending cuts in 2003, when foreign debt payments of about $19 billion come due.
"For the next year their position is secure; the question is the year 2003," said Aleksei Zabotkine, chief economist at the United Financial Group, an investment bank based in Moscow. "If the oil price doesn't reverse itself, then we will see a rather unpleasant situation."
Even so, Russia has never followed through on past promises to cut oil exports, and most analysts here do not expect this time to be different.
"Russia wants to appease OPEC, but it will not do anything concrete," said Dmitri Avdeev, an oil analyst at United Financial. "Exports might fall because of seasonal factors, but production will continue to rise."

HEADLINE: Deal Brings Indian Casino in the Catskills Closer to Reality 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Gambling in the Catskills moved a step closer to reality yesterday, as the St. Regis Mohawk Indian tribe signed an agreement with the world's largest gambling company to build and run a casino at the venerable Kutsher's Country Club in Monticello.
 Progress toward a Mohawk casino has accelerated greatly, after moving in fits and starts since the mid-1990's. Last month, the State Legislature approved up to six Indian casinos in New York, including three in the Catskills and three in western New York. 
 Those projects still face expected legal challenges from casino opponents that could delay work for years, but most parties were treating yesterday's development as a milestone. 
Other important steps remain, including federal approval of the agreement and the location, a compact between the Mohawks and Gov. George E. Pataki and approval from the National Indian Gaming Commission, an arm of the Department of the Interior.
But people involved in those processes say that they expect them to go fairly smoothly, and that the only significant obstacles left are the legal challenges. "We're pretty optimistic that if the timetable goes reasonably as we expect, we should be able to break ground next year," said Thomas E. Gallagher, chairman and chief executive of Park Place Entertainment, the Mohawks' partner. "We expect to be open sometime in 2004."
The $500 million project, including a 750-room hotel, would represent a dramatic turnabout in the region's long-sagging economic fortunes.
The Pataki administration wants the state to receive up to 25 percent of gross profits from slot machines, the largest source of profits in a casino. The Mohawks and Park Place have already agreed to pay $15 million a year to Sullivan County.
The deal signed yesterday provides that after those payments, 70 percent of casino profits would go to the tribe and 30 percent to Park Place. 
The governor's office is trying to negotiate compacts simultaneously with the Mohawks and the Seneca Nation of Indians.
A framework agreement reached earlier this year with the Senecas, and the bill approved by the Legislature, call for the Senecas to have a casino in Niagara Falls, one in Buffalo and one at an undetermined location in western New York.
But the Seneca compact is not as far along as the Mohawks', and has been complicated by tribal politics. The Senecas have not chosen a developer or specific sites, and they have been reluctant about a compact provision making it easy for casino workers to unionize, a condition imposed by the state.
Some Seneca factions oppose gambling, while others say the leaders are not driving a hard enough bargain with the state. The deal is subject to a tribal referendum.
A 1988 federal law allows states and tribes to enter into gambling compacts. Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo negotiated two such compacts, for the Mohawks' casino in Hogansburg, in northern New York, on the Akwesasne reservation near the Canadian border; and for the Oneida Nation's Turning Stone Casino on its reservation in central New York, near Utica. The state receives no revenue from them.
Federal law also allows for Indian casinos situated away from reservations, on land held "in trust" for the tribe. That provision has been used successfully just once, in Wisconsin, and the Mohawks and Senecas are attempting to use it again.
A state court ruled early this year that an off-reservation casino required the Legislature's approval. The Department of the Interior must give special clearance for a casino away from tribal lands, but indications are that that will not be a serious obstacle.
