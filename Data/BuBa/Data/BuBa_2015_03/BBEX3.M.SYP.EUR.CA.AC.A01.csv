"","General: * Referred to as ""neighbour rate for non-commercial transactions"" until the end of 2003.   Syria has a multiple exchange rate system: information on how the exchange rates are used is either incomplete or only available with a time lag.   The Syrian pound - except the free market rate (""neighbour rate for non-commercial transactions"") - was peggedto the US dollar.   From January 2001, the Commercial Bank of Syria set neighbour rates for non-commercial transactions. We have information about these rates from September 2002 onwards. In January 2003, the central bank provided us with the following information on the use of the exchange rates:   Official exchange rate (USD 1 = SYP 11.20 / 11.25): for a few debt service payments on the basis of bilateral payment agreements. Neighbour rate (from 2004: official exchange rate; USD 1 = SYP 46.00 / 46.50): for most foreign exchange transactions (including for certain export revenue and import payments of public sector enterprises, as well as for capital inflows). ""Neighbour rate for non-commercial transactions"" (USD variable rate): for revenue from diplomatic missions, medical expenses, for grants to students, transfers from abroad and for foreign travel. The budget accounting rate of USD 1 = SYP 46.45 / 46.50 applied to certain transactions by general government until the end of 2003.   The exchange rate system was modified on 3 January 2004. The budget accounting rate was harmonised with the neighbour rate and published as the official rate thereafter. The neighbour rate for non-commercial transactions became the free market rate.   Use of exchange rates from January 2004 to December 2006: Official exchange rate (until the end of 2004: USD 1 = SYP 48.50 / 48.65, from January 2005: USD 1 = SYP 49.85 / 50.00): for public sector transactions. Free market rate (USD variable rate): for private sector transactions. The former official exchange rate of USD 1 = SYP 11.20 / 11.25 still exists for a few debt service payments on the basis of bilateral payment agreements.  On 1 January 2007, the official exchange rate and the free market rate were standardised; however, the exchange rate of USD 1 = SYP 11.20 / 11.25 still exists for a few debt service payments on the basis of bilateral payment agreements.",
