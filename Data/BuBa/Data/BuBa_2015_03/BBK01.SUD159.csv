"","General: Volume-weighted average rates of all new agreements concluded during the reporting month. The effective interest rates are calculated either as annualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents, guarantees and credit insurance. Secured loans for home purchase, including building and home improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name and for their own account. For the purpose of MFI interest rate statistics, a loan is considered to be secured if collateral (inter alia financial collateral, real estate collateral, debt securities) in at least the same value as the loan amount has been posted, pledged or assigned. p = Provisional",
