"","General: * March 2002 - June 2013: reference rates; until February 2002: so-called non-oil export rate.   Iran used a multiple exchange rate system. On 21 March 2000, the export rate was replaced by the non-oil export rate. This was the floating rate at which exporters had been able to sell their currency earnings on the Tehran Stock Exchange for some time.   Exchange rate used until 20 March 2002:  Official exchange rate (USD 1 = IRR 1,750 / 1,755): for earnings from crude oil exports which are used to pay for the import of essential goods and services, for priority projects and for servicing government debt.  ""Non-oil export rate"": for other foreign exchange transactions.   On 21 March 2002, the multiple exchange rate system was standardised on the basis of the non-oil export rate. Since then, the Iranian central bank has published (daily) reference rates.   From the end of 2011, the spread between the reference rate and the parallel market rate, which has been used by the foreign exchange bureaux for some time, has widened considerably; see commentaries on value (BBEX3:M:IRR:EUR:CA:AC:A01).   Since 3 July 2013, rather than issuing reference rates, the Central Bank of Iran has been publishing exchange rates that deviate sharply from the reference rates. The non-reference rates, which were published for a short time from 1 October 2012 onwards, are now made available as official ratesas a result of the reference rates becoming less and less important in the wake of the autumn 2012 reforms.   The term ""toman"" (an old Persian currency) is also used to denote 10 Iranian rials.",
