"","General: * The exchange rates have been classified as indicative rates since November 1994. While the multiple exchange rate system was in place in 1993: official exchange rate. On 24 February 1993, a multiple exchange rate system was established with the introduction of legal free market rates. Official exchange rate: for the government's foreign exchangetransactions. Free market rate: for all other transactions. Although the unification of the system was announced in March 1993, the free market rates continued to exist (alongside the official exchange rate); they only began to be officially confirmed again at the end of June 1993. The exchange rate system was unified on 18 October 1993.  The term""Kenya pound"" is a unit of account equivalent to 20 Kenya shillings.",
