"","General: Most frequently occuring interest rate for new business within the reporting period (the two middle weeks of a given month). The average rates are calculated as unweighted arithmetic means from the interest rates reported to be within the spread. The spread is ascertained by eliminating the reports in the top 5% and the bottom 5% of the interest rate range. Interest rates as % per month of original amount of credit taken up. Besides interest, most banks charge a one-off processing fee (generally 2%, in some cases 3%, of the credit amount).",
