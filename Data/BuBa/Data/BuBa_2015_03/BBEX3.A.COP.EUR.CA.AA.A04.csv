From April 2003, the quoted figures are comparable rates calculated on the basis of the exchange rates for the US dollar in Colombia in conjunction with the respective euro reference exchange rate of the European Central Bank for the US dollar; annual averages calculated on the basis of reporting date rates (generally one rate per week).",
