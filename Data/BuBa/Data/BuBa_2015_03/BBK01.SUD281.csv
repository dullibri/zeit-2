The amount refers to the single loan transaction considered as new business. Excluding overdrafts. For the purpose of MFI interest rate statistics, a loan is considered to be secured if collateral (inter alia financial collateral, real estate collateral, debt securities) in at least the same value as the loan amount has been posted, pledged or assigned. p = Provisional",
