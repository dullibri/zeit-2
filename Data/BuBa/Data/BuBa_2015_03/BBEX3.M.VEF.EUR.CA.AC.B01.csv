"","General: * Known as official exchange rate II until the end of 2010.  A multiple exchange rate system was introduced on 11 January 2010.  Use of exchange rates from 11 January to 31 December 2010  Official exchange rate I (see BBEX3:M:VEF:EUR:CA:AC:A01): For certain capital inflows and public-sector debt service payments (excluding the oil sector); for unrequited transfers (including pension and benefit payments abroad and foreign currency transactions by diplomatic missions) as well as for imports of important consumer and producer goods.  Official exchange rate II: For almost all other public and private sector foreign exchange transactions (including export revenue from oil deliveries).  In addition, various transactions (eg servicing of private external debt) were carried out using an exchange rate stipulated by the national government and the Venezuelan central bank.  On 1 January 2011, the official exchange rates I and II were standardised on the basis of the second exchange rate. However, in addition to the regulated purchase of foreign currency via the official market under an approval procedure, a parallel market (SITME = Sistema de Transacciones con Titulos en Moneda Extranjera) existed until 8 February 2013. Those who were not taken into consideration in the official market could acquire foreign currency in the SITME via the limited purchase of government dollar-denominated bonds and their sale abroad. From the beginning of 2011 to 8 February 2013, the exchange rate remained unchanged at USD 1 = VEF 5.30.  On 9 February 2013, the bolívar was devalued.  Since 25 March 2013, registered importers of important goods who have not been allocated foreign exchange on the official market have had the opportunity to get limitedforeign exchange through foreign exchange auctions (SICAD = Sistema Complementario de Administración de Divisas). After the first auction at the end of March 2013, when - according to press reports - the exchange rate stood at USD 1 = VEF 13.10, the auction process was modified in July 2013 and the group of participants was extended to include registered domestic households. Furthermore, the alternative forex trading system SICAD II (Sistema Cambiario Alternativo de Divisas) was introduced with effect from 24 March 2014.  Exchange rate application  Official exchange rate: For debt service payments by public-sector entities and for authorised transactions.  SICAD (BBEX3:M:VEF:EUR:CA:AC:B06):For the purchase of foreign currency by registered importers and since July 2013 also for registered domestic households (inter alia for studying abroad and for health, sport and cultural purposes).  SICAD II (BBEX3:M:VEF:EUR:CA:AC:B05): For the purchase of foreign exchange by natural and legal persons, eg in the form of foreign notes and coins and currency cheques (including traveller's cheques) and for the sale of foreign currency to domestic households and importers in the form of foreign notes and coins as well as traveller's cheques or for credit transfers.",
