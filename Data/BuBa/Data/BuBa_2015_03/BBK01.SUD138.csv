"","General: Volume-weighted average rates of all new agreements concluded during the reporting month. The effective interest rates are calculated either as annualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents, guarantees and credit insurance. The amount refers to the single loan transaction considered as new business. p = Provisional",
