"","Methodology: * Since March 2003, we only have data on exchange rates for the US dollar; comparable rates were calculated on the basis of buying and selling rates for the US dollar in Paraguay in conjunction with the respective euro reference exchange rate of the European Central Bank for the US dollar. Annual averages were calculated on the basis of reporting date rates (generally one rate / comparable rate per week).",
