"",General: From June 2010 including revolving loans. New business is collected in the same way as outstanding amounts for the sake of simplicity. This means that all outstanding lending business at the end of the month has to be incorporated in the calculation of volumes. From January 2003 up to May 2010 estimated. The volume of outstanding amounts reported was extrapolated to form the underlying total using the Horvitz-Thompson estimator. From June 2010 the data are based on monthly balance sheet statistics. Overdrafts are defined as debit balances on current accounts. They include all bank overdrafts regardless of whether they are within or beyond the limits agreed between customers and the bank. Revolving loans are loans that have all the following features: 1) the borrowers may use or withdraw funds to a pre-approved credit limit without giving prior notice to the lender; 2) the amount of available credit can increase and decrease as funds are borrowed and repaid; 3) the credit may be used repeatedly; 4) there is no obligation of regular repayment of funds. p = Provisional,
