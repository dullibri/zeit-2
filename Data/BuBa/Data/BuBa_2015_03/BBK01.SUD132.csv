"","General: New business is collected in the same way as outstanding amounts for the sake of simplicity. This means that all outstanding deposit business at the end of the month has to be incorporated in the calculation of average rates of interest. The effective interest rates are calculated either as annualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents, guarantees and credit insurance. Credit card debt: Convenience credit is defined as the credit granted at an interest rate of 0% in the period between the payment transactions effectuated with the card during one billing cycle and the date at which the debt balances from this specific billing cycle become due. Extended credit is defined as the credit granted after the due date of the previous billing cycle has passed, i.e. debit amounts on the card account that have not been settled when this was first possible, for which an interest rate usually greater than 0% is charged. Often minimum instalments per month have to be made, to at least partially repay extended credit. p = Provisional",
