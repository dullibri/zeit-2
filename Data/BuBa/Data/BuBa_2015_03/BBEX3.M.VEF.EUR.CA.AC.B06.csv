"","General: * Multiple exchange rate system. Since 25 March 2013, registered importers of important goods who have not been allocated foreign exchange on the official market have had the opportunity to get limited foreign exchange through foreign exchange auctions (SICAD = Sistema Complementario de Administración de Divisas). After the first auction at the end of March 2013, when - according to press reports - the exchange rate stood at USD 1 = VEF 13.10, the auction process was modified in July 2013 and the group of participants was extended to include registered domestic households. We do not have any auction rates for the period April to November 2013.  Furthermore, the alternative forex trading system SICAD II (Sistema Cambiario Alternativo de Divisas) was introduced with effect from 24 March 2014.  Exchange rate application  Official exchange rate (BBEX3:M:VEF:EUR:CA:AC:B01): For debt service payments by public-sector entities and for authorised transactions.
