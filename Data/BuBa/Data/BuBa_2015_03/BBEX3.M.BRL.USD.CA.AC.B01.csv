"","General: Currency conversion on 1 July 1994 at the rate of 2,750 cruzeiro real (BRR) = 1 real (BRL).  Multiple exchange rate system; for commercial banks' rates, see BBEX2:M:BRL:USD:CA:AC:A01. Exchange rate used until 31 January 1999:  Commercial banks' rate (taxa comercial): for all foreign exchange transactions not settled at the free market rate.  Free market rate (taxa flutuante): for all unrequited transfers (including pension and remittance payments), for certain services (including the provision of foreign exchange for travel purposes and currency exchange for foreign tourists, also via international credit cards), as well as for certain overdue loan redemptions; also for certain capital transfers by Brazilians based abroad.  The multiple exchange rate system was standardised on 1 February 1999.",
"","Source: Calculated on the basis of the buying and selling rates of the Dresdner Bank Lateinamerika AG, Hamburg (formerly: Deutsch-Südamerikanische Bank AG).",
"","Comment on 1999-01: Owing to increasing exchange rate pressures, the central bank expanded the range against the US dollar on 13 January 1999 and switched to an independent floating rate two days later.",
