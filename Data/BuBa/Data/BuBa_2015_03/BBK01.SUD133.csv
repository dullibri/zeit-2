"","General: Volume-weighted average rates of all new agreements concluded during the reporting month. The effective interest rates are calculated either as annualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents, guarantees and credit insurance. For the purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as business, debt consolidation, education etc. Excluding overdrafts. p = Provisional",
