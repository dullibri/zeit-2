"","Methodology: * We only have data on exchange rates for the euro in Colombia up until March 2003. From April 2003, the quoted figures are comparable rates calculated on the basis of the buying and selling rates for the US dollar in Colombia in conjunction with the respective euro reference exchange rate of the European Central Bank for the US dollar; annual averages calculated on the basis of reporting date rates (generally one rate per week).",
