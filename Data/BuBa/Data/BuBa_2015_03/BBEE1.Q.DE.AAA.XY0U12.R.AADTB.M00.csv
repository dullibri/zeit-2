"","Methodology: Geometrically weighted indicator of price competitiveness, based on the deflators of total sales.                                     Weighting scheme drawn up on the basis of foreign trade in the field of manufacturing (SITC 5-8). Starting with the period between 1995 and 1997, the weighting is updated every three years. The final respected weighting period until the current date: years between 2007 and 2009. In order to capture third-market effects, export shares were derived on the basis of the principle of ""double weighting"".
