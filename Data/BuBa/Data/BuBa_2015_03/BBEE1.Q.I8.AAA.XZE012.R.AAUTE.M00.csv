Where Unit Labour Costs in total economy were not yet available, estimates have been used.                                            The weights used in these calculations are based on manufactured goodstrade and capture third-market effects.                            For details of the methodology see ECB, Monthly Bulletin, March 2012 as well as the ECB's Occasional Paper No.134, which can be downloaded from the ECB's website (www.ecb.int).",
