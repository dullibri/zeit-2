"","Methodology: Based on the weighted averages of the euro or, prior to 1999, of the exchange rates of the currencies preceding the euro against the currencies of the following countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the UnitedKingdom and the United States.                       Where GDP-deflators were not yet available, estimates have been used.                                                                 The weights used in these calculations are based on manufactured goodstrade and capture third-market effects.                            For details of the methodology see ECB, Monthly Bulletin, March 2012 as well as the ECB's Occasional Paper No.134, which can be downloaded from the ECB's website (www.ecb.int).",
