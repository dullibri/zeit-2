"","General: * The official exchange rate for the US dollar has remained unchanged since October 1982 at IQD 1 = USD 3.224933/3.208889 (buying/selling rate). However, in addition, parallel market rates have existed for several years; we do not have any information about their application, exchange rate information only received sporadically from press reports.Following the outbreak of the Iraq war on 20 March 2003 and the end of major combat operations on 1 May 2003, an official exchange rate to the US dollar was re-established on 4 October 2003 (USD 1 = IQD 1900) with the start of regular foreign exchange auctions. The comparable rates for the euro were calculated on the basis of the US dollar exchange rate in conjunction with the ECB's euro reference exchange rate for the US dollar. Buying and selling rates for the euro have been published since January 2005; the mid-market rate was calculated on the basis of these rates.",
