"","General: Most frequently occuring interest rate for new business within the reporting period (the two middle weeks of a given month). Since January 1991 the rates of banks in the new Länder have been included in the interest rate survey. The average rates are calculated as unweighted arithmetic means from the interest rates reported to be within the spread. The spread is ascertained by eliminating the reports in the top 5% and the bottom 5% of the interest rate range. Interest rates as % per month of original amount of credit taken up. Besides interest, most banks charge a one-off processing fee (generally 2%, in some cases 3%, of the credit amount). Up to May 1986, credits of DM 5,000 and more but less than DM 10,000; from June 1986 up to October 1996, DM 5,000 and more but less than DM 15,000 and maturities of more than 24 months but not more than 48 months; from November 1996 up to December 2001, DM 10,000 and more but not more than DM 30,000.",
