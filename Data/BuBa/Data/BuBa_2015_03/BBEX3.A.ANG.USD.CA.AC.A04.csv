"","General: The Netherlands Antilles, a Dutch overseas territory in the Caribbean, was dissolved with effect from 10 October 2010. Curaçao and Sint Maarten (the southern part) are now autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Meanwhile, the islands of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba (also known as the BES islands) received the status ""specialmunicipalities"" of the Netherlands. Until the end of December 2010, the Netherlands Antillean guilder also remained legal tender on the BES islands, but was replaced by the US dollar at the beginning of 2011.  The Netherlands Antillean guilder is pegged to the US dollar .",
