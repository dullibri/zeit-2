"",Source: Bundesbank special survey among 116 banks in 24 towns and cities,
"","Methodology: Beleihungsauslauf is the German term used to express the ratio of a loan to the mortgage lending value of an asset purchased, where the mortgage lending value is generally calculated by means of a haircut on the market value and is intended to reflect the sustainable value of a property. Given that the concept used in Germany differs from other concepts widely used internationally, a comparison of the average Beleihungsauslauf with average loan-to-value ratios from other countries is very difficult.",
