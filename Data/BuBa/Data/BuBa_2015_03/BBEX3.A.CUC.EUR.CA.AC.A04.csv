"","General: The ISO code CUC was introduced on 1 March 2009.   Alongside the convertible peso (CUC), which is primarily used by foreigners, there is the Cuban peso (CUP), which is used by residents to purchase their basic needs, among other things.   Foreign currencies can be freely exchanged in Cuba for convertible pesos (CUC), and they enable both residentsand foreigners to purchase items which the government considers to be luxury articles.   In its national accounts, the Cuban government fixes the ratio of convertible peso (CUC) to Cuban peso (CUP) at 1:1. In reality, Cuban pesos can only be exchanged for convertible pesos at a considerable discount.",
