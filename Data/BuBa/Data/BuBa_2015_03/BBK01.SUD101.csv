"","General: New business is collected in the same way as outstanding amounts for the sake of simplicity. This means that all outstanding deposit business at the end of the month has to be incorporated in the calculation of average rates of interest. The effective interest rates are calculated either as annualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents, guarantees and credit insurance. p = Provisional",
