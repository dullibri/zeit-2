"","Methodology: * Since the end of May 2003, we only have data on exchange rates for the US dollar; comparable rates for the euro were calculated on the basis of the buying and selling rates for the US dollar in Mexico in conjunction with the respective euro reference exchange rate of the European Central Bank for the US dollar. Up until 2011, the annual averageswere calculated on the basis of reporting date rates (generally one rate / comparable rate per week) and since 2012 on the basis of month-end rates.",
