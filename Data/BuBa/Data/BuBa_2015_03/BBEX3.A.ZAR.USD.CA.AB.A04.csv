"","General: * Until 12 March 1995: official exchange rate. Use of exchange rates (until 12 March 1995): Official exchange rate: for all foreign exchange transactions not carried out at the financial rate. Financial rate: ""financial rand"" balances arise at the authorised banks from the sales proceeds of investments. The proceeds are obtained by foreigners not domiciled in South Africa and cannot be transferred in foreign currencies. These ""financial rand"" balances can be transferred without restriction between foreign investors not domiciled in South Africa; they can be used for reinvestment in South African securities listed on the stock exchange or for other equity investments permitted by the authorities from case to case. The multiple exchange rate system was unified on 13 March 1995.",
