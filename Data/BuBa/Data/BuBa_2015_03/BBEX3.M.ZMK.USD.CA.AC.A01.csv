On 1 May 1987, the termination of the foreign exchange auctions was announced and the kwacha was pegged to the US dollar on 4 May 1987. 9 November 1988: pegged to the SDR.   19 February 1990 - 22 April 1991: multiple exchange rate system. Official exchange rate: for proceeds from traditional exports (mostly copper), for payments for the import of petroleum and fertilisers and for other approved imports, as well as for certain capital inflows. Market rate (separate time series): for proceeds from the export of non-traditional goods, for imports on the ""general list of imports"" (especially chemical products), for foreign exchange proceeds from foreign travel and receipts for foreign embassies, as well as for non-public investment and transfer payments.  With effect from 1 January 2013, a currency conversion took place at the rate of 1,000 (old) kwacha = 1 (new) kwacha; the new ISO currency code is ZMW. The currency conversion did not entail any appreciation or depreciation against other currencies.",
