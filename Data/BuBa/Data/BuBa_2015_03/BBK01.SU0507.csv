"","General: Lending to enterprises excluding lending to the housing sector (with agreed maturities of more than five years) with agreed interest locked in for more than five years. Up to December 1998, with agreed maturities and interest locked in for four years and more. Up to December 2001, loans of DM 200,000 and more but less than DM 1 million. From the reporting month September 2000, effective interest rates are calculated according to the ISMA method (International Securities Market Association). The use of the ISMA method (non-linear remuneration of less than one year) in this context tends to result in slightly lower effective annual interest rates. The spread is ascertained by eliminating the reports in the top 5% and the bottom 5% of the interest rate range.",
