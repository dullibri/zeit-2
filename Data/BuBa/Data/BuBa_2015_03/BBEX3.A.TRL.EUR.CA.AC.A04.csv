"","General: In addition to the official exchange rates published by the central bank, from 1994, the commercial banks set their own rates for a time. These rates could deviate significantly from the central bank rate over the course of a day. Currency conversion effective from 1 January 2005: 1,000,000 Turkish lira (TRL) = 1 New Turkish lira (TRL), designatedas Turkish lira (TRL) since 1 January 2009.",

"","Comment on 2001: On 22 February 2001, the exchange rate arrangements for the Turkish lira were changed; since this date, Turkey has used an independent floating exchange rate system. This measure led to sharp exchange rate fluctuations. The following exchange rates (buying/selling rate) were reported to us by the Turkish central bank at the start of trading:  22 February 2001: EUR 1 = TRL 626,858 / 629,881  23 February 2001: EUR 1 = TRL 867,168 / 871,350  26 February 2001: EUR 1 = TRL 972,449 / 977,139  27 February 2001: EUR 1 = TRL 860,192 / 864,341",
