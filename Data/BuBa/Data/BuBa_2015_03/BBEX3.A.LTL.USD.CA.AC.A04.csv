"","General: The litas (LTL) was legal tender in Lithuania from 25 June 1993 to 31 December 2014. The temporary currency, the talonas (TAL), was converted to the litas at a rate of TAL 100 = LTL 1. From 1 April 1994 to 1 February 2002, the litas was pegged to the US dollar and from 2 February 2002 to 31 December 2014, it was pegged to the euro (EUR 1 = LTL 3.4528). Lithuania joined the euro area on 1 January 2015; irrevocable euro conversion rate: EUR 1 = LTL 3.45280.",
