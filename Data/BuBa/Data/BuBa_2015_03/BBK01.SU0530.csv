"","General: Most frequently occuring interest rate for new business within the reporting period (the two middle weeks of a given month). The average rates are calculated as unweighted arithmetic means from the interest rates reported to be within the spread. The spread is ascertained by eliminating the reports in the top 5% and the bottom 5% of the interest rate range. Total rate of return: rate of return which is paid when savings plans are held until maturity or when savings objektives have been achieved. Up to December 2001, savings deposits of DM 20,000 and more but less than DM 50,000; from January 2002, EUR 10,000 and more but less than EUR 25,000.",
