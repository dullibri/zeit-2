"","General: Interest rates as % per month of original amount of credit taken up. Besides interest, most banks charge a one-off processing fee (generally 2%, in some cases 3%, of the credit amount). The spread is ascertained by eliminating the reports in the top 5% and the bottom 5% of the interest rate range.",
