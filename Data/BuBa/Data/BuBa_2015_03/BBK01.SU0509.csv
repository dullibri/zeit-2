"","General: Most frequently occuring interest rate for new business within the reporting period (the two middle weeks of a given month). The average rates are calculated as unweighted arithmetic means from the interest rates reported to be within the spread. The spread is ascertained by eliminating the reports in the top 5% and the bottom 5% of the interest rate range. Lending to enterprises excluding lending to the housing sector (with agreed maturities of more than five years) with agreed interest locked in for more than five years. Up to December 1998, with agreed maturities and interest locked in for four years and more. From the reporting month September 2000, effective interest rates are calculated according to the ISMA method (International Securities Market Association). The use of the ISMA method (non-linear remuneration of less than one year) in this context tends to result in slightly lower effective annual interest rates. Up to December 2001, loans of DM 1 million and more but less than DM 10 million.",
