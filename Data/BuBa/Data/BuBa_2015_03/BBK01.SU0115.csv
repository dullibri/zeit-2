"","General: The base rate pursuant to section 247 of the Civil Code has replaced the base rate as per Discount Rate Transition Act (time series BBK01:SU0114) from January 2002 wherever the latter is used as a reference variable for interest and other payments in Federal legislation (in the field of civil law and judical procedural law), in state legislation (as stipulated in the Act introducing the Civil Code) or in executory instruments and contracts based on such regulations. Starting at 3.62%, it is adjusted on 1 January and 1 July of each year (for the first time on 1 January 2002) by the percentage points by which the reference variable (ECB's most recent main refinancing operation, marginal rate)has increased or decreased since the last change in the base rate. Pursuant to Article 4, section 1 of the Act on the Amendment of Provisions concerning the Evaluation of Insurance Enterprises' Capital Investment, the Discount Rate Transition Act and the Regulation Governing the Use of the Base Rate as a Reference Variable have been repealed. Pursuant to Article 4 section 2 of the same Act, from 4 April 2002 the discount rate and the base rate under the Discount Rate Transition Act were replaced by the base rate pursuant to section 247 of the Civil Code. This means that, from 4 April 2002, the base rate pursuant to the Discount Rate Transition Act finally ceases to have any relevance to anyclaims arising from that date onwards. Therefore, holders of claims, to which the base rate under the Discount Rate Transition Act still applied after 1 January 2002, have to adjust their calculation of interest immediately with the entry into force of the Act on the Amendment of Provisions concerning the Evaluation of Insurance Enterprises' Capital Investment and the Repeal of the Discount Rate Transition Act.",
