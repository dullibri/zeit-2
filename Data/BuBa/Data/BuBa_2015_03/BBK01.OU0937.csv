"","General: Up to 1998, bill-based loans; from 1999, bill portfolio. Bill-based loans = bill portfolio plus endorsement liabilities arising from rediscounted bills and from the bill portfolio before maturity for the collection of bills sent. Owing to the treatment of statistical breaks and revisions in the time series, see the section headed ""Data interpretation"" in the ""General notes"".",
