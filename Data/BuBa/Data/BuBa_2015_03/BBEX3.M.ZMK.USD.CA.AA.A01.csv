Market rate (separate time series): for proceeds from the export of non-traditional goods, for imports on the ""general list of imports"" (especially chemical products), for foreign exchange proceedsrevenue from foreign travel and receipts for foreign embassies, as well as for non-public investment and transfer payments.
